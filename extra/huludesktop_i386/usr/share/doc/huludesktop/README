Thanks for trying out Hulu Desktop for Linux!

README
  Hulu Desktop for Linux is currently built for Fedora 9+ and Ubuntu 8.04+. 
  The packages should also work on any Linux distribution with glib v2.16+ and 
  gtk2.0 v2.12+, but only Fedora 9+ and Ubuntu 8.04+ are supported. 

  You must have Adobe Flash Player 9.0.124 or higher installed. If you can 
  load and watch videos on Hulu.com, you should be able to use Hulu Desktop for 
  Linux.  For 64-bit distributions, we recommend the 64-bit flash runtime, 
  which can be found on the Adobe Labs website (see below).

USING A REMOTE CONTROL
  Hulu Desktop for Linux supports input from hundreds of infrared remote 
  controls using the LIRC open source package. You can download LIRC and find 
  general configuration information, as well as browse a list of supported 
  remote controls, on http://www.lirc.org. 

  *** Hulu Desktop for Linux requires that lircd (>= 0.8.2) be run with the -r 
  (--release) switch.
  
	If you are using Fedora, you can add the line
        LIRCD_OPTIONS="-r" 
	under the start() section of /etc/init.d/lirc 

	If you are using Ubuntu, you can add the line 
	REMOTE_LIRCD_ARGS="-r"
	to /etc/lirc/hardware.conf

  Hulu Desktop reads key mappings from /etc/huludesktop/hd_keymap.ini and 
  ~/.huludesktop.  

  The button values are:
    0: Up
    1: Down
    2: Left
    3: Right
    4: Enter
    5: Menu  

  An example hd_keymap.ini entry:
    [mceusb]
    Up=0
    Down=1
    Left=2
    Right=3
    OK=4
    Home=5
    ChanUp=0
    ChanDown=1
    VolUp=0
    VolDown=1
    Back=5

  This entry defines multiple buttons (corresponding to the output of the 
  'irw'. 

  An example ~/.huludesktop [remote] section:
    [remote]
    lirc_device = /dev/lircd
    lirc_remote_identifier = mceusb
    lirc_release_suffix = _UP
    lirc_repeat_threshold = 10
    button_name_up = Up
    button_name_down = Down
    button_name_left = Left
    button_name_right = Right
    button_name_select = OK
    button_name_menu = Home,Back

  You can define buttons and your own lirc-configuration specifics in this file.

  *** If you are using a custom release suffix other than "_UP", you can modify
  it using the 'lirc_release_suffix' configuration value.

RUNNING ON 64-BIT
  For problems with flash on 64-bit linux, see 
  http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html for more information.

  To install the 64-bit flash plugin, download the tarball 
  libflashplayer-10.*.linux-x86_64.so.tar.gz and extract it:
    $ tar -zxvf libflashplayer-10.0.22.87.linux-x86_64.so.tar.gz

  Point ~/.huludesktop to libflashplayer.so by modifying the flash_location
  value under [flash]:
    [flash]
    flash_location = /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so

  You may need to run 'sudo ldconfig' or reboot if you experience the application
  closing immediately after initialization.
  
SCREENSAVER ISSUES
  Currently, xdg-screensaver [suspend,resume] is being used to control the 
  screensaver when video is being played back in full screen (not in menu mode).
  
  For some users with screensavers that don't work with xdg-screensaver, you
  can specify commands for Hulu Desktop to run instead it wants to suspend/resume
  the screensaver during playback.  They exist under [screensaver] in ~/.huludesktop:
  
  If you have an executable script called "screensaver.sh" in /home/user/scripts/ that
  responds to --suspend or --resume flags, your configuration should look like this:
  
  [screensaver]
  suspend_script = /home/user/scripts/screensaver.sh --suspend
  resume_script = /home/user/scripts/screensaver.sh --resume

  Note: please use absolute paths to the scripts (do not use ~/)
