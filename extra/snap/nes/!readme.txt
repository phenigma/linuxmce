 --- M \ K NES Box Art Archive ---

I. ABOUT

  This archive contains box art images from Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games.  We (M \ K Productions) did not scan these images; we gathered them from various web sites (see below), touched them up a little, and renamed them.  The goal of this archive is to provide box art images for the most popular U.S. NES games, and name them in a manner so that they can be seamlessly incorporated into our NES emulator, UberNES.  

 If you are using UberNES in conjunction with these images, simply unzip the archive file(s) and place all of the .JPG images in one directory.  Then, from UberNES, click Tools...Options from the menu, select the "Directories" tab, and select the appropriate box art directory.  Then, if you already have created a NES Database, you should click from the menu NES Database...Configure, and then click the "Restore All Default Links" button.  This will update all of your DB box art links so that they point to the proper files contained in this archive.  If you create a new database these links will automatically be created by UberNES v2 rev 1 or later.
