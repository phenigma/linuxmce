Release 0.7.0
=============

+ Continued building SuperSample.  It's still not done, but it does
  show a bit more now, including one way to do frame rate limiting.
  This was supposed to be added to PF, but because of some problems I
  ran into in implementing it, I'm leaving it out, at least for now.
  See this example if you want to set a frame rate in your games.
+ Added "desktopZoom" attribute to m_config structure.  This allows you
  to zoom the window size to any multiple on a desktop PC.  You CAN
  use this on a PocketPC device as well, it won't bomb or anything,
  but it's pretty much pointless there, so generally you should 
  simply not set any value at all, which will zoom to 1x, a 240x320 
  window as usual in other words.  Setting it to zero or one does the 
  same thing.  Any other value will simply multiply the width and height 
  by that amount.  So, if you do m_config.desktopZoom=2; in your Init 
  method, you will get a window that is 480x640, =3 would give you 
  720x960, etc.
+ Built lib files are now included with the PF distribution.  I'm not
  sure if they were prior to 0.6.1, but they weren't in that release,
  and they probably should be, if for no other reason than convenience.
  They are separated out in directories for PocketPC, PocketPC 2002
  and x86 (desktop).
+ Added sample "hekkus" to show how to hook into that sound library
  without needing to use PocketFrogPlus (PF development can now continue
  independant of Hekkus!)  You will need to install Hekkus of course and
  be sure to read the comments in hekkus.cpp to see how to set up paths.
+ Added sample app by Damian Ancukiewicz to show how to use pixel shaders. 
  Included are three useful shaders: greyscale shader, fade shader and 
  an 8-bit shader. 
+ Added two methods to Game class: void GameSuspend() and
  void GameResume().  These are called, as you would expect when the
  application is suspended (i.e., low battery warning message) and
  resumed (i.e., message is dismissed) accordingly.  These are needed
  to properly hook into sound libraries such as Hekkus.  Override them
  and do whatever you please with them.  See the Hekkus sample for
  usage example.
+ Added Rasterizer::FillPoly to draw filled polygons.  Pass it
  (Point[], int pointCount, Pixel).  The method only handles convex 
  polygons and polygons that are vertically concave, that is, a polygon 
  cannot have more than two edge points on the same horizontal line.
  Thanks to Andreas Hedström for optimizing and improving my original 
  code for this function.  See SuperSample for an example.
+ Added Rasterizer::BlitRotatedStretch to draw surfaces that are both
  stretched and rotated, at the same time.  Pass it 
  (int destx, int desty, float angle, const Surface* source, 
  Surface* stretch_surface, const Rect* src_rect).  The width and
  height of stretch_surface are taken to be the dinensions to stretch
  the surface to.  Remember that you must delete the surface when you
  are done with it.  You can reuse it as many times as you want first.
  Note that this implementation is nothing more than calls to the
  BlitStretch and BlitRotated methods, in that order.  As such,
  performance is no better than calling these two yourself individually.
  This should only be thought of as a convenience method for now (the plan
  is to implement it properly as a combined transformation matrix,
  which should be noticeably better performing).
  Thanks to Andreas Hedström for the original implementation.
- Removed all sample projects from the "Make" workspace.
! Fixed a bug in the VGADrawText function that caused the X location
  to be ignored in all cases.  You should now be able to position
  text anywhere on the screen.
! Fixed some errors that would keep PF from compiling for Win32 (I
  had never done that in the prior version so I didn't see the errors).
  Also made similar changes to the samples so they will compile
  when targeted to Win32, so everything should now compile and
  run properly on a desktop as well as a PocketPC device.



Release 0.6.1
=============
Note: Frank W. Zammetti took over maintenance and development of
PocketFrog starting with this release.  For contact info and
further PocketFrog info, please visit http://www.omnytex.com/pf

+ Overloaded Rasterizer::DrawRect so that it accepts
  (Rect, Pixel) or (int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, Pixel).
+ Overloaded Rasterizer::FillRect so that it accepts
  (Rect, Pixel) or (int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, Pixel).
+ Overloaded Rasterizer::SetPixel so it accepts
  (Point, Pixel) or (int x, int y, Pixel).
+ Overloaded Rasterizer::DrawCircle so it accepts
  (Point, int radius, Pixel) or (int x, int y, int radius, Pixel)
+ Overloaded Rasterizer::DrawLine so it accepts
  (Point, int length, Pixel) or (int x, int y, int length, Pixel)
+ Overloaded Rasterizer::DrawHLine so it accepts
  (Point, int length, Pixel) or (int x, int y, int length, Pixel)
+ Overloaded Rasterizer::DrawVLine so it accepts
  (Point, int length, Pixel) or (int x, int y, int length, Pixel)
+ Overloaded Rasterizer::Blit so it accepts
  (Point, Surface*, Rect*) or (int x, int y, Surface*, Rect*)
+ Added Rasterizer::DrawPoly to draw polygons.  Pass it
  (Point[], int number_of_points, Pixel).
+ Added Rasterizer::DrawVGAText to draw 8x16 VGA-standard text.
  Pass it (unsigned char* pFont, TCHAR* string, int align, int locX,
  int locY, Pixel).
+ Added new sample app: supersample.  This will eventually showcase
  all PocketFrog functions in some way.  For now it is just using
  the DrawVGAText function to show some text.
! Fixed a problem with the VLine algorithm function that was causing
  any vertical line to be drawn one pixel too short on the bottom.
  This is why DrawRect and FillRect was always missing the bottom
  right-hand corner pixel, which is fixed by this as well.



Release 0.6.0
=============

+ Blit with rotation: Rasterizer::BlitRotated()
+ Blit with stretching: Rasterizer::BlitStretch()
+ By popular request: Surface::GetPixel() method
+ New sample "Rotate" to show off blits with rotation
+ Added EVC 3.0 project files for the existing samples



Release 0.5.3
=============

+ Support for HPC 2000 devices.

+ Support for PocketPC emulators (PPC and PPC2002).
+ Dirty rectangle is now used in method Display::Update().
! Fixed potential memory leak when accessing the screen DC.



Release 0.5.1
=============

+ Added missing method CreateRasterizer() to class DisplayDevice.

+ Optimized Blit() / Clear() primitives for normal rasterizer.
+ Faster GAPI emulation (SimpleGAPI.cpp)
+ Emulation now runs zoomed (x2).
