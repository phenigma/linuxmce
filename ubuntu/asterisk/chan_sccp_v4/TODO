Needs testing
============================================================================
Fix Check sccp reload:
  - sccp.conf reloading / reset necessary devices

Fix RegContext SubscriptionId (segfault during module load after unload)

Remote capabilities check: test remote channel is sccp channel -> use preferred codecs (mostly done, test transfer hold needed -MC)

MaxCallBR to "automaticly" choose audio and video codec

Automatically Detect nated devices



Needs fixing

Fix NAT/DirectRTP/EarlyRTP Issues

Fix Cisco Communicator Support (mostly done -MC)

Fix when phone looses connection and tries to re-connect within keepalive time, it is locked out of connecting

Fix Conference + ConfList

Fix Pressing a shared line button, while another phone is on a call using the same shared line.

Handle control_frame receipt of AST_CONTROL_HANGUP when previous channel->state AST_CONTROL_REDIRECTING -> finish tranfer/blindtransfer

CallerId Exchange > ast 1.8: benuzten von ast_channel_queue_connected_line_update, ast_channel_update_connected_line fur pickup und transfer. 
  mit callback function (ast_channel_queue_connected_line_update) wenn das target connected ist.

Pickup: eigentlicher pickup code sollte in ein seperate function liegen, damit die fur grouppickup und directpickup nicht wiederhollte werden musste (sccp_do_pickup -> calls -> PBX(do_pickup)).

CLI_Macro's saubern: Da sollte ich noch mal durch gehen und die per asterisk version spalten.

Crossover device registration: It happens after module unload chan_sccp.so, module load chan_sccp.so and a 7985 phone is connected during it. 


Objectives 1.8
============================================================================

Finish Configuration
- use global codecs for device

Automatic enabling of directrtp when possible / desired

Improve codec selection, up/downgrade codec on resume

Improve status display (Cfwd / DND / Privacy) (implemented via device->status.indicator (CS_ADV_FEATURES)). Updates needed: Only display when active indicator.

Add Support IPV6

Dynamic configuration for devices
 - add cli interfaces to manipulate configuration and save sccp.conf

Cond_wait/Cond_timedwait for several situations
 - open receive
 - pbx indication
 - dialtimeout (cond_timedwait)
 - scheduler
 - pbx_channel handover

Make tested configure options standard, and remove configure flags (and reduce preprocessor checks in the sources)
 - realtime (add on/off switch to global sccp.conf section)
 - dev_state
 - park
 - pickup

Add sccp.conf Option to save protocol messages from phone -> asterisk to use for device debugging purposes.

Add support for Call Completion Supplementary Services (ccss) / *5 / Call caller back as soon as device becomes available

Add CLI/AMI interfaces for master/slave switchover (token message)

Add FeatureButton to monitor Parkinglot + CiscoXML List of parked calls inc ase there is more than one call so you can select one.

pbx_impl documentation: Wenn wir die function in pbx_impl_ast nicht static machen und die header fur diese functionen in pbx_impl.h legen wurde, konnte mann die pbx_impl functions dort documentieren, statt in jeder einzelne ast???.c file. Ist das ok, oder gibt es da noch probleme ?



Short Term
============================================================================
Rewrite manager and cli interfaces to use the same function and also produce xml (similar to other asterisk channel drivers do) (also checkout chan_ss7 cli methods) (partially implemented)

Generate sample sccp.conf and sccp.sql files from ConfigOption (initial implementation in sccp config generate / contrib/gen_sccpconf)
 - check used sccp.conf file version and upgrade if necessary on start

Add Perl Protocol Testing script (sccp_protocol.h would need to be reformatted)

Video Provider abstraction: Implement abstraction layer for video source and sink.



Long Term
============================================================================
Add 1.4 support to pbx_impl

Add template option for realtime either using templates from sccp.conf or template entry in database

Add FreeSwitch/CallWeaver/Yate/??? support to pbx_impl

Video Call Client Software (Java, Applet, Webstart).

Add Video Handling for Conference (One Sender, Multiple Viewer, Multicast)

Enforce lock hierarchies:
  - Extend every thread with a thread_local int current_lock_hierarchy_level"
  - Before locking check if the current lock hierarchy level is lower than the lock level
    - If true -> set current_lock_hierarchy_level to lock level
    - If false -> use try_lock once.
      - on success -> set current_lock_hierarchy_level to lock level
      - on failure -> if holding one lock already
        - if one lock already -> conditional wait on this onelock
	- if more than one lock :
	  - release all locks begotten via trylock in current thread 
	    conditional wait on last lock begotten via normal lock
  - On unlock -> set current_lock_hierarchy_level to previous lock level



New Features
============================================================================
New Parameter CFwdUnRegistered -> Here you can set a Number to be dialed when a device has not registered or unreachable(kirk / nokia-icc)
