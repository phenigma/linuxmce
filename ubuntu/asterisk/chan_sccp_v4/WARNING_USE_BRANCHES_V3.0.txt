Chan-sccp-b V3.0 has moved to branches/V3.0 to make place for the upcoming
V4.0 in this trunk directory. 

If you want to keep using the V3.0 stable branch, please use the switch
command like:
svn switch https://chan-sccp-b.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/chan-sccp-b/branches/V3.0

or checkout a clean copy using:
svn co https://chan-sccp-b.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/chan-sccp-b/branches/V3.0 chan-sccp-b_V3.0

V4.0 with asterisk 1.8 / 1.10 support will be copied here shortly.

Regards,

the Chan-SCCP-b Team
