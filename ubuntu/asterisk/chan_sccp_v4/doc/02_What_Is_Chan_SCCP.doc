 * \section 	what_is_chan_sccp 	What is Chan_SCCP
 * 
 * Chan_SCCP is a replacement Channel Driver for chan_skinny in the Asterisk Channel Driver Library. It delivers
 * better performance, scalability, interoperability and functionality than either chan_skinny or chan_sip on a 
 * SCCP capable phone. It is still under heavy development but a stable release is also available for you to use.
 *
 * To read more about asterisk, you can find a nice introduction <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/asterisk.html">here</a>.
 * 
 * \subsection 	what_sccp_ss1		SCCP in relation to SIP/IAX/MGCP
 *
 * There are several methods to communicate with a VOIP Server. Next to the well known SIP Protocol there are 
 * Several others like: MGCP, IAX, IAX2, SS7 and SCCP. The SCCP protocol is sometimes refered to as SKINNY. 
 * 
 * Several VOIP Phone Resellers have create phones that use the SCCP Protocol. The most well known at this moment
 * is CISCO, but there are others like Kirk, Ixia, Symbol Techologies, SocketIP, Digium and Nokia.
 *
 * IPBlue markets a software phone (soft phone) which uses SCCP for signaling and emulates a Cisco 7960 hardware phone.
 *
 * \subsection 	what_sccp_ss2 		SCCP as a Protocol
 * 
 * The Skinny Call Control Protocol a.k.a Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP, Q.713, or short Skinny) is a 
 * proprietary network terminal control protocol originally developed by Selsius Corporation. The term "Skinny" 
 * reflects that SCCP is a simple and uncomplicated ("lightweight") protocol requiring relatively little computer 
 * processing. 
 * 
 * The SCCP technology is now owned and defined by Cisco Systems, Inc. as a messaging system between a Skinny 
 * client and the Cisco CallManager. Examples of skinny clients include the Cisco 7900 series of IP phones, 
 * Cisco IP Communicator softphone and the 802.11b wireless Cisco 7920.
 * 
 * Skinny is a lightweight protocol which allows for efficient communication with Asterisk. The SCCP Protocol 
 * is a lower level protocol when compared to for example SIP. It works on Layer 3/4 of the OSI Layer Model.
 *
 * The SCCP protocol layer supports connectionless and connection-oriented protocol services, 
 * and network management procedures are carried out on a per protocol service basis, that is, network management
 * procedures at SCCP are independently treated for connectionless and for connection-oriented protocol services. 
 *
 * It uses the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) over UDP-transport for the bearer traffic (real-time audio stream) 
 * with other Skinny clients or an H.323 terminal. SCCP is a stimulus-based protocol and is designed as a 
 * communications protocol for hardware endpoints and other embedded systems, with significant CPU and memory constraints.
