 * \section problems  Reporting Issues/Problems
 * 
 * When reporting problems / issues via the sourceforge mailinglist or bug/issue report pages please include as much information as possible. 
 * And try to describe you problem/issue as acquarate as possible.
 * 
 * At least include the following information:
 *  - Operating System
 *  - Installed version of Asterisk
 *  - Installed version of chan_scpp. When using the trunk version, please include the revision number ($Revision: -1 $).
 *  - Asterisk Debug Report (see \ref generating_a_debug_report section)
 *  - In case of registration errors, also include the TFTP Files which are used by the device
 *  - In case of dialplan issues, include the part of the dialplan in question.
 *  .
 * When reporting issues/problems be patient. We will try and get back to you as soon as possible, but time is sometimes scarce. Other users of chan_sccp are very welcome to answer any questions if they know the answer of course. 
 *
 * \subsection generating_a_debug_report Generating a Debug Report
 *  
 * To generate a debuig report please take the following steps:
 *   - switch on the "all" section in logger.conf. 
 *   - Restart Asterisk
 *   - In cli (asterisk -rvvvvvvvvvvv) enter: sccp debug device,channel,line,event (or more or event all).
 *     You can get a list of all debug categories when you type "sccp debug". Try to match your problem area with one or more of the debug categories.
 *   - Reproduce the error you encountered. 
 *   - When done, stop asterisk
 *   - Attach the /var/log/asterisk/all (might be stored in a different location on your os) file to your error/issue report. 
 * 
 * A less exact method is to cut and paste the information from CLI.
