What is the license for the zaptel driver?
===================================================

Brief F.A.Q
===========

Q. Zaptel compiled with no errors but when I try to modprobe zaptel I
receive "FATAL: Error insering zaptel (/lib/modules/2.6.x.x/misc/zaptel.ko):
Unknown symol in module or unknown parameter (see dmesg)

A. You need to recompile your kernel with CONFIG_CRC_CCITT=y or
CONFIG_CRC_CCITT=m. To do this, run 'make menuconfig' and change it under 
'Library Routines -> CRC-CCIT functions'. If you compiled it as a module,
load it, otherwise reboot.

How do I report bugs or contribute?
===================================
Please report bug and patches to the Asterisk.org bug tracker at
http://bugs.digium.com in the "zaptel" category.

Does anything use this library so far?
======================================
Yes, the Asterisk Open Source PBX does. http://www.asterisk.org
