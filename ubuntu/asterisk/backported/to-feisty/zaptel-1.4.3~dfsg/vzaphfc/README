== General Info ==

This is a Zaptel driver for HFC-S PCI A based ISDN BRI cards (Cologne
Chipdesign).

== Driver Build ==

You need the kernel source (2.6) and the Zaptel driver sources
to build the module.

== Module Parameters ==

  nt_modes:
  comma seperated list 

  sniff_zaptel_d_channel:
  Make frames transmitted from Zaptel appear as received by the board
  Set this to 1 if you want to debug D channel signaling with Etherreal

  force_l1_up:
  Keep ISDN bus activated. Usually set by PtP TE interfaces.

  nt_modes:
  Comma-separated list of card IDs to configure in NT mode (array of int)

== Information in the proc file system ==

  You will find valuable data about the current state of your ISDN
  interface in /proc/drivers/vzaphfc/<cardnum>. The following files
  are present for each card:

  info:
  Information about the bus activation, transmit errors (CRC), and 
  overall transfer statistics

  bufs:
  Except from the data that is currently transmitted

  fifo:
  sizes and counter values from the FIFOs, mainly for debugging
