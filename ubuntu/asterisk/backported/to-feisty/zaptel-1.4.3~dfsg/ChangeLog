	  * Tested with zaptel-1.2.17.1 * Add D-Channel TX, RX and BAD
	  frames count in /proc/xpp/XBUS-*/XPD-*/bri_info * Adjust output
	  of xpp_sync script. Pad for 8 port BRI. * Added a debugging
	  module parport_debug (not compiled by default). * Added an
	  optional patch to zaptel: - compiles only if ZAPTEL_SYNC_TICK is
	  defined - Allow interested driver to register for "sync"
	  notification. - Does not affect drivers that do not use this
	  feature. * Added external synchronization feature: - Only if
	  ZAPTEL_SYNC_TICK feature is compiled in - Than XPP may be
	  synchronized by another card (e.g: an Astribank with FXS can be
	  synchronized by a Digium PRI card). - May be enabled/disabled in
	  runtime via the 'sync_tick_active' module parameter to the xpp.ko
	  module. * Fixed a potential bug in D-Channel hexdump printing. *
	  New visual indications in BRI leds: - Constant ON RED/GREEN:
	  Shows the port type -- NT/TE. - Very fast "double blink": Layer1
	  work, no D-Channel yet. - Steady blinking (1/2 sec): D-Channel
	  trafic detected. * xpp_fxloader moved to /usr/share/zaptel . *
	  adj_clock removed: never really used. * Now we have
	  Zaptel::Hardware and a sample zaptel_hardware script (not
	  (installed by default). * We also have a sample perl zapconf (not
	  installed by default) which aims at replacing genzaptelconf (sans
	  the modules detection).

	  Fix several places where we treat confmode as a bitmask. It is a
	  bitmask...sort of.. I'll explain.. confmode is used for 2
	  different things. It defines both the "mode" and the "flags" of
	  the conference. The "mode" part is in 0x00FF and is NOT bitwise.
	  The "flag" part is in 0xFF00 and *IS* bitwise. Confused yet?
	  Good. So, when we want to check the "mode" of the conference, we
	  need to check only within 0xFF. There were several places where
	  this was not happening - but due to luck, it worked (...sort of).
	  That's what this patch fixes. ........

	  * Add a real version of the xpp modules to them (independent of
	  the Zaptel version). * Update our line status even when not

	  protocol version: 2.4 (Zaptel 1.2.12/1.4.0 had 2.3). XPS Init
	  scripts renamed accordingly.
