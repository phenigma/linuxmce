squeezelite (1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Refresh Makefile-tweaks.patch due to Makefile rewrite.
  * Enable full hardening build flags:
    - Add DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS := hardening=+all
  * Add squeezelite-pa compiled with PortAudio instead of ALSA:
    - Add new squeezelite-pa binary package
    - Add Build-Depends on portaudio19-dev
    - Add Makefile-portaudio.patch
    - Adjust debian/rules to build twice with different options
    - Minor shuffling around to accommodate the new package
  * Remove no-upstream-changelog lintian override now that there is one.
  * Add lintian override for debian-watch-may-check-gpg-signature; no signatures
    are available.
  * Fix typo: suppored/supported (typo-fix-suppored.patch).
  * Update man page to document new/changed options.
  * Update debian/copyright for included dsd2pcm source.
  * Enable DSD (Direct Stream Digital) and DoP (DSD over PCM).
  * Confine to linux-any for the time being; builds fail on kFreeBSD / Hurd.
