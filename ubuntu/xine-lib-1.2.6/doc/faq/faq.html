     The xine engine is a free media player engine. It comes in the form of
     a shared libarary and is typically used by media player frontends
     and other multimedia applications for playback of multimedia streams
     such as movies, radio/tv network streams, DVDs, VCDs.
    </p><p>
     Since there are several frontends for the xine library available,
     this document has a problem when it comes to examples.
     The two most common frontends xine-ui and gxine are mixed in command
     line examples throughout this FAQ. When you use a different
     frontend, some of these will not work for you. The filename of
     the config file also varies amongst frontends. If you get confused,
     I recommend you try with one of xine-ui or gxine.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="scope"></a>What's the aim and scope of this text?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     The primary goal of this FAQ is to cover all recurring questions related
     to the xine engine. Frontend specific questions are usually not covered here.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="wheretogethelp"></a>My question is not yet covered here – where can I ask for help?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     First of all be sure that your question is really not covered here and
     that you haven't just been a bit too lazy to read through all of this
     text. ;-). Also check out the documentation specific to
     the frontend (e.g. <span class="command"><strong>xine-ui</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>gxine</strong></span> or
     <span class="command"><strong>totem</strong></span>).
    </p><p>
     That said – you are welcome to mail to our user mailing list:
     <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:xine-user@lists.sourceforge.net">xine-user@lists.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;</code>
     Please provide some info about your setup so people have a chance to
     help you, e.g. include information about your audio/video hardware
     and drivers you use, operating system, cpu type and some console
     output/any error messages. Also include command line parameters you
     have specified and information about the type of stream you're
     trying to play back. Also very important is the version of xine
     you're using and information about any additional plugins you
     may have installed on your system.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="pronounce"></a>How do I pronounce "xine"?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     As long as people know what you are talking about, you are free to
     pronounce it the way you like, but the official pronounciation is
     [ksi:n], like the name "Maxine" with the "Ma" removed.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="modules"></a>What are those xine-lib, xine-ui, gxine, … Mercurial repositories for?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     Some time ago xine just became too complex to be just one big program.
     Therefore it was split into two major parts.
    </p><p>
     xine-lib is simply speaking the engine of xine. It contains all basic plugins
     and is necessary to run anything that relies on xine. (This is the part that
     is covered in this FAQ.)
    </p><p>
     Then there are frontends – applications that use xine. The most
     common frontend is that of a media player. There are currently
     three frontends being developed in the xine project: xine-ui, a skinned
     dvd-player style frontend directly based on xlib; gxine, a desktop
     media-player style frontend using the standard GTK widget set; and
     xine-plugin, a plugin for browsers such as Firefox.
     External projects like kaffeine, sinek and totem develop additional frontends.
     In the future you will likely see more and different types of applications
     being developed which will use the xine engine for video processing
     and other multimedia purposes.
    </p><p>
     If you simply want a media/dvd player, you'll need to install xine-lib
     first and then choose and install a player frontend like xine-ui or gxine.
    </p><p>
     Other repositories include <code class="filename">xine-project-www</code>,
     which contains the xine project website sources, and various packaging
     and development branches.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="hg"></a>Where and how do I get the latest development version?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     Be advised that end-users should stick to the official xine releases.
     The Mercurial repositories are only intended for developers and for others who know why they use it.
    </p><p>
     The repositories are listed at <a class="ulink" href="http://hg.debian.org/hg/" target="_top">http://hg.debian.org/hg/</a>;
     however, this is a list of all repositories which are kept there, not just the
     xine project's (which are the ones which begin with <code class="filename">xine-lib/</code>). To check one out:
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>hg clone http://hg.debian.org/hg/<code class="filename">repository</code> <code class="filename">local_copy</code></strong></span></pre><p>
     e.g.
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>hg clone http://hg.debian.org/hg/xine-lib/xine-lib xine-lib</strong></span></pre><p>
    </p><p>
     You can see a full list of repositories by visiting
     <a class="ulink" href="http://hg.debian.org/hg/xine-lib/" target="_top">http://hg.debian.org/hg/xine-lib/</a>.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="cvs"></a>Don't you use CVS?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     We used to, but there are some significant problems with CVS. Merging
     is easier with Mercurial (and, for that matter, git); and we can commit
     changes locally, change them if mistakes have been made, then make them
     public whenever we're ready.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="patch"></a>How do I submit patches?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     See the xine Hackers' Guide, chapter 3, "How to contribute".
     (This is available online at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.xine-project.org/hackersguide#contribute" target="_top">http://www.xine-project.org/hackersguide#contribute</a>.)
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="binaries"></a>Where can I find pre-compiled binaries, e.g. RPMs?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     The xine project does not provide pre-compiled binaries for legal
     reasons (some parts of xine may be covered by patents in some countries).
     Some OS projects/vendors (e.g. Debian, FreeBSD, …) offer binaries
     for their distributions – please contact them or use their package search
     tools for further info.
     You can also find links to third parties providing xine RPMs on
     the xine homepage at
     <a class="ulink" href="http://www.xine-project.org/releases" target="_top">http://www.xine-project.org/releases</a>.
    </p><p>
     See the next section of this FAQ for instructions on how to build xine
     from source.
    </p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="building"></a>Building and installing xine from source</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="buildrequirements"></a>What do I need to compile everything properly?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     First of all an official and stable release of gcc. Also be aware
     that patched gcc versions may break parts of xine and are therefore
     not supported by the xine project.
    </p><p>
     Furthermore you'll have to use GNU make to compile xine. On most GNU/Linux
     systems "make" is GNU make – on other platforms use "gmake" instead.
     Also, zlib is required (including the appropriate header files, which are
     often found in a package called zlib-devel or similar.)
    </p><p>
     If you want to compile xine from Mercurial, you'll need to have the autobuild tools
     installed (automake, autoconf and libtool – in recent versions).
    </p><p>
     Frontends might need additional libraries, e.g. for gxine you'll need to have
     GTK2 installed. Make sure you have not only the shared libraries themselves
     but also the header files (often packaged seperately as so-called -dev packages)
     on your system.
    </p><p>
     Some plugins that come with the xine engine need additional libraries (otherwise
     they will not be built). For example, libogg and libvorbis (plus their include files)
     are needed for ogg/vorbis support. Most notably, if you want to see any video
     on your X11 desktop (and that's what you're here for, isn't it?), you need the
     X developer packages as well.
    </p><p>
     Don't worry about this too much right now, xine's <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span>
     (see below) will check for all the stuff needed and will tell you what's missing
     (which means that you should check the output it produces carefully ;) ).
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp62381664"></a>How do I compile xine?</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="simplebuildinstr"></a> Simple build instructions for beginners </h4></div></div></div><p>
      Download the latest xine-lib and gxine/xine-ui tarballs, then follow
      these instruction. To unpack a tarball, use:
      </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>tar xfvz tarballname.tar.gz</strong></span></pre><p>
     </p><p>
      The following instructions will install xine in <code class="filename">/usr/local</code>
      where it will be visible for all users. You need root privileges to do this on most systems.
     </p><p>
      After unpacking xine-lib, issue:
      </p><pre class="screen">
   <span class="command"><strong>./configure</strong></span>
   <span class="command"><strong>make install</strong></span></pre><p>
     </p><p>
      Make sure your <code class="filename">/etc/ld.so.conf</code> contains
      <code class="filename">/usr/local/lib</code> and continue with:
      </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>ldconfig</strong></span></pre><p>
     </p><p>
      Now unpack your frontend (gxine or xine-ui or …), then:
      </p><pre class="screen">
   <span class="command"><strong>./configure</strong></span>
   <span class="command"><strong>make install</strong></span></pre><p>
     </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="completebuildinstr"></a>Complete build instructions</h4></div></div></div><p>
      The build process is the same for all of the xine modules.
     </p><p>
      You have to start with xine-lib. If built and installed successfully, you
      can continue with the frontend(s).
     </p><p>
      If you have installed xine-lib to a non-standard prefix, make sure
      that you have <code class="filename">$prefix/bin</code> in your PATH and that your linker finds
      libs in <code class="filename">$prefix/lib</code> – otherwise trying to build modules that
      rely on xine-lib will fail with configure complaining about not
      finding certain parts of libxine. Using bash you can do something like:
      </p><pre class="screen">
   <span class="command"><strong>export PATH="$prefix/bin:$PATH"</strong></span>
   <span class="command"><strong>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$prefix/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"</strong></span></pre><p>
      to make sure libxine can be found by the frontend(s).
     </p><p>
      Last but not least. Here the build instructions. As stated earlier,
      those are the same for every xine module.
      </p><pre class="screen">
   <span class="command"><strong>./autogen.sh</strong></span> [→ <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> if you're building from hg]
   <span class="command"><strong>./configure</strong></span>
   <span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span>
   <span class="command"><strong>make install</strong></span></pre><p>
     </p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="rpmbuild"></a>Making your own RPM packages (xine-lib, xine-ui, gxine)</h3></div></div></div><p>
     Basically you will only have to issue one command, if you have just
     downloaded a source tarball from our web site:
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>rpmbuild -ta &lt;THE_NAME_OF_YOUR_SOURCE_TAR_BALL&gt;</strong></span></pre><p>
     (Older versions of RPM use <span class="command"><strong>rpm</strong></span> instead of <span class="command"><strong>rpmbuild</strong></span>.)
    </p><p>
     This will start the binary and source RPM building. After compiling is
     finished, a binary rpm is placed in your rpm binary directory which is
     something like <code class="filename">/usr/src/RPM/RPMS/&lt;YOUR_ARCHITECTURE&gt;</code>
     and a source RPM is written to your rpm source dir
     (e.g. <code class="filename">/usr/src/RPM/SRPMS</code>).
    </p><p>
     In case that you have an up-to-date hg repository, you will need to do the
     following first in order to get a tarball release out of it which you
     can later use with the <span class="command"><strong>rpmbuild -ta</strong></span> command above:
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>./autogen.sh &amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp; make dist</strong></span></pre><p>
    </p><p>
     In any case, please keep in mind that you have to build and install
     xine-lib first before you can proceed with xine-ui.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="debbuild"></a>Making your own .deb packages (xine-lib, xine-ui, gxine)</h3></div></div></div><p>
     You'll need an HG snapshot tarball or source checked out from the repository.
    </p><p>
     First, make sure that the "devscripts" and "build-essential" packages are installed. You'll
     then need the following commands (the first one isn't needed unless you're using a snapshot tarball):
     </p><pre class="screen">
   <span class="command"><strong>tar xzf &lt;PACKAGE-VER.tar.gz&gt;</strong></span>
   <span class="command"><strong>cd &lt;PACKAGE-VER&gt;</strong></span>
   <span class="command"><strong>./autogen.sh noconfig</strong></span>
   <span class="command"><strong>debuild binary</strong></span>
     </pre><p>
     (If <span class="command"><strong>debuild</strong></span> complains about unmet dependencies, then
     install them using <span class="command"><strong>aptitude install &lt;PACKAGES&gt;</strong></span> (as root) then re-run
     <span class="command"><strong>debuild binary</strong></span>.
    </p><p>
     Once the build has been successfully completed, you'll have some new .debs.
     </p><pre class="screen">
   <span class="command"><strong>cd ..</strong></span>
   <span class="command"><strong>ls *.deb</strong></span>
   <span class="command"><strong>su - -c 'cd '"`pwd`"' &amp;&amp; dpkg -i &lt;DEB_PACKAGES&gt;'</strong></span>
     </pre><p>
     Ubuntu users will probably want to use this instead of that <span class="command"><strong>su</strong></span>:

     Yes, you can do so by setting the CFLAGS variable and then running
     <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> again. You can even pass them to
     <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> directly. Example:
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>./configure CFLAGS="-march=i686"</strong></span></pre><p>
    </p><p>
     Other user variables <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> respects are:
     </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="command"><strong>CC</strong></span> to specify the compiler executable

        <span class="command"><strong>CPP</strong></span> to specify the C preprocessor executable
       </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="command"><strong>LD</strong></span> to specify the linker executable
       </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="command"><strong>CPPFLAGS</strong></span> to pass additional include paths or other

        <span class="command"><strong>LDFLAGS</strong></span> to pass additional library paths or other
        linker options
       </p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
     An example combining some of these would look like:
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>./configure CC="/opt/intel/bin/icc" LD="/opt/intel/bin/xild" \

     If you have a recent gcc you can try to compile "more" k7 support in (esp.
     better instruction scheduling). If the configure script should fail to
     detect your processor/gcc correctly, try passing the canonical system name for
     your machine to configure with the <span class="command"><strong>--host</strong></span> option, e.g.

      In order to be able to compile xine-lib, you need (amongst other things)

     </p><p>
      Read again carefully the output <span class="command"><strong>./configure</strong></span>

      If you want to have Xv support compiled in, make sure you either have
      a shared Xv library on your system, e.g.
      <span class="command"><strong>ls /usr/X11R6/lib/libXv*</strong></span>
      should give you some .so libs, like this:
      </p><pre class="screen">

   /usr/X11R6/lib/libXv.so
   /usr/X11R6/lib/libXv.so.1</pre><p>
     </p><p>
      Alternatively you need to have libtool 1.4 or newer installed, then
      libXv.a is sufficient. Otherwise you can create the shared versions yourself:
      </p><pre class="screen">
   <span class="command"><strong>ld --whole-archive -shared -o libXv.so.1 libXv.a</strong></span>
   <span class="command"><strong>ln -s libXv.so.1 libXv.so</strong></span>

      Now you should be ready to build the Xv video-out plugin on your system.

      First of all take a closer look at the compilation instructions above again.
      You will probably find your answer there right away.
     </p><p>
      As stated there (there again that hint *grin*), make sure that you
      have <code class="filename">$prefix/bin</code> in your path and that your
      linker is able to find libraries installed in <code class="filename">$prefix/lib</code>
      By the way, $prefix is where you installed your xine-lib to earlier
      (yes, installing xine-lib with <span class="command"><strong>make install</strong></span> or
      installing the corresponding distribution-provided -dev or -devel
      package would be a good idea before trying to compile the frontend ;)
      ).
     </p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="nonrootbuild"></a>Can I install xine in my home directory (without being root)?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     Sure. First set up a subdir where you install your private software, eg.
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>mkdir ~/xine</strong></span></pre><p>
    </p><p>
     Then you have to set a few environment variables – it's probably a good
     idea to add this to your <code class="filename">~/.bashrc</code> (or somewhere similar):
     </p><pre class="screen">
   <span class="command"><strong>export PATH="$HOME/xine/bin:$PATH"</strong></span>
   <span class="command"><strong>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/xine/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"</strong></span></pre><p>
    </p><p>
     Now you can unpack tarballs e.g. in <code class="filename">~/xine/src</code>
     (<span class="command"><strong>mkdir ~/xine/src</strong></span> if necessary) and do a
     </p><pre class="screen">
   <span class="command"><strong>./configure --prefix=$HOME/xine</strong></span>
   <span class="command"><strong>make install</strong></span></pre><p>
    </p><p>
     You also need to tell frontends using xine-lib, where to find it:

      Newer xine (1.0.x) releases come with a full-featured
      DVD plugin that should be able to handle any unencrypted,
      non-locked DVD with full menu navigation support. No external
      plugins are required anymore here.
     </p><p>
      To get DVD playback working, first make sure you have
      a symlink <code class="filename">/dev/dvd</code> pointing to your
      DVD device on your system. For example, if your DVD drive
      is the master ide drive on the second IDE channel,
      <code class="filename">/dev/dvd</code> should point to
      <code class="filename">/dev/hdc</code>. Please note that if you
      are using the ide-scsi emulation on your system, it is
      likely that your DVD drive got mapped to a scsi device
      node even though it is an ide drive. In that case first
      check out you boot/kernel logs (or run <span class="command"><strong>cdrecord -scanbus</strong></span>)
      to find out which device it got mapped to and set the
      symlink accordingly (should be something like <code class="filename">/dev/scd0</code>,
      <code class="filename">/dev/scd1</code>, … in that case).
      Also make sure you (as a user) have sufficient (read and write) permissions
      on your DVD drive. This could mean you either have to change the device
      permissions or add your user to a special group
      (e.g. <span class="command"><strong>addgroup cdrom username</strong></span>),
      depending on your setup and/or distribution.
     </p><p>
      It is highly recommended to switch DMA mode on for your DVD drive
      (without it even very recent machines will have trouble producing
      smooth video output). Use a command like
      <span class="command"><strong>hdparm -d 1 &lt;device&gt;</strong></span>
      on your DVD device. Please note that even if you're using ide-scsi
      you will have to set the dma flag on the ide device node (e.g.
      <code class="filename">/dev/hdc</code>), not the mapped <code class="filename">/dev/scd</code>
      scsi device.
     </p><p>
      To be able to play back encrypted DVDs you need to have
      libdvdcss installed on your system (please check if this is legal where
      you live). If you do not understand what the term "encrypted DVD" means
      here: As a rule of thumb, every DVD you have to pay money for is most
      likely encrypted.
     </p><p>
      To make matters worse, apart from encryption, there is another obstacle
      to take: the region code. The DVD authorities decided to divide the world
      into eight geographical regions. Have a look at
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.dvdforum.gr.jp/RegionMap.pdf" target="_top">http://www.dvdforum.gr.jp/RegionMap.pdf</a>
      if you want to know which number has been assigned to your country. It is
      now their idea, that you shall only play DVDs, which have been produced
      for your region. If you take a DVD off the shelf in your local store,
      you should find a little globe-like icon which shows the region code the
      disc is for.
     </p><p>
      Newer (post-2000) DVD drives (so-called RPC-2 drives) check the DVD
      region, which means they'll prevent you from playing back DVDs that have
      a different region code from what the drive is set up for. Some drives
      come with a factory setting of region 0 so they can play back
      any DVD until a region code is set. Others refuse to play any DVD at all
      until they are told a region. The easiest way to handle this is to use
      the regionset utility from
      <a class="ulink" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=31346&amp;release_id=168415" target="_top">
       http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=31346&amp;release_id=168415
      </a>.
     </p><p>
      Once you have everything set up, try something like
      <span class="command"><strong>gxine dvd:/</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>xine -p dvd:/</strong></span>
      to start dvd playback. Some frontend also offer so-called autoplay
      buttons or menu entries that start dvd playback immediately.
     </p><p>
      Important: do not try to mount the DVD. Just insert it and hit the DVD autoplay
      button or start xine from the command line.
     </p><p>
      If things do not work as expected, try running the <span class="command"><strong>xine-check</strong></span>
      shellscript that comes with xine to see if this gives you further hints on
      what could be wrong.
     </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="dvdlongwait"></a>DVD playback works, but it takes a long time until playback starts</h4></div></div></div><p>
      This points to a region code problem. Some versions of libdvdcss can play
      back DVDs from other regions than the RPC-2 DVD drive is set up for,
      but this usually means a cryptographic attack (which takes time) has
      to be used to access the DVD.

     xine supports VCD and SVCD playback out-of-the box. Similar to DVDs,
     make sure you have a <code class="filename">/dev/cdrom</code> alias pointing

        When you open the configuration dialog of your frontend, you should
        see a <em class="parameter"><code>vcd</code></em> config section. An important setting is
        <em class="parameter"><code>default_device</code></em>. If this is set to the empty string,
        the VCD plugin will try to scan your drives for a suitable device if the
        driver has the capability to scan for drives. However you can set
        the device to something of your choosing. On GNU/Linux, this may be

        Your frontend should offer a VCD autoscan button or menu item.
        If you select this, you should see your CD disk light go on if you have one.
        And the CD should be read. You should get a playlist of what's on the VideoCD.
       </p><p>
        If not something's wrong, possibly you configured the wrong drive.
        You might try to read a disk image of a VideoCD and thus elimate any problems
        with hardware. You can get a test VideoCD disk image to test here:

        </a>.
        After unzipping this there should be files <code class="filename">test_svcd_pal.cue</code> and
        <code class="filename">test_svcd_pal.bin</code>. Run xine with the MRL

        <code class="filename">vcd:/test_svcd_pal.cue:E0</code>.
        If you see something playing then this is a hardware problem.
        You might also want to try starting playback-control with

       </p><p></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        There should be at least one "track", and one "entry" listed for
        the VideoCD and the names of these in the MRL list will end with
        "T1" and "E0" respectively. Often there are other playlist items,
        and if you have menus or still frames there will be
        "segments" as well. The simplest things to check are probably
        "entries" and "tracks". If there are no entries listed or none of
        the tracks or entries play, then there may be a problem with
        that particular medium. So as in the step above, you can try a known good
        sample and perhaps burn a CD from that. More likely if you get this
        far, some of the items listed work and some do not. There are a
        number of debugging switches that you can dynamically turn on and
        off that may be able to help in isolating more specific problems.
        See the <a class="link" href="#vcddebug" title="VideoCD debugging">section below</a>.
       </p><p></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Something plays now, but you do not get any menus? Well, first is there
        supposed to be a menu? In the last step you should have seen what is on
        the VideoCD. Still frames are always "segments" so see if you can find one in the MRL
        list and select that.
       </p><p>
        If there are no segments listed, there aren't any still-frame
        menus. It's also possible to have menus in looping MPEG's. Use the
        <span class="command"><strong>vcddump</strong></span> tool to find loops. <span class="command"><strong>vcddump</strong></span> is
        also part of VCDImager. Another program that can help you examine the contents
        of a VideoCD is <span class="command"><strong>vcdxrip</strong></span>.
       </p><p>
        To troubleshoot, start out with the known SVCD example that has a
        still-frame menu at the beginning:

         http://www.vcdimager.org/pub/vcdimager/examples/test_svcd/test_svcd_pal.zip
        </a>
        Inside this is a largish file called <code class="filename">test_svcd_pal.bin</code> and another
        short text file called <code class="filename">test_svcd_ntsc.cue</code>. These are CD disk
        images; that is, something that could be burned to a CD drive such
        as with <span class="command"><strong>cdrdao</strong></span>. However you don't have to create a CD to view these
        with the xine VCD plugin. You should be able to play the VideoCD by running the MRL

        <code class="filename">vcd:/test_svcd_pal.cue</code>.
        If you see a still frame on startup. Great! If instead you see what
        looks like the beginning of a movie (Blue Streak with Martin Lawrence)
        then go to the next step.
       </p><p></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        You have a VideoCD with menu and can see it, but there is no menu on startup?
        If you have the VideoCD from the last step, then run the MRL

        <code class="filename">vcd:/test_svcd_pal.cue:P1</code>
        If this shows a still frame, but it just does not show when you
        hit either the "VCD" autoscan button or give a MRL without the P1 at
        the end then go to the next step.
       </p><p>
        If you have another VideoCD, from the MRL list, you should also see "playlist"
        entries. Try selecting the one that ends "P1". If you don't see an entry with P1,
        then your VideoCD does not have playback control (PBC) and although there may
        be a still frame on the VideoCD it may have been authored so it is not easily
        accessed. Again <span class="command"><strong>vcddump</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>vcdxrip</strong></span> can help here.

     Quicktime is just a system layer (container format) which can contain various
     different audio and video formats. The system layer itself is fully supported
     in xine. However, some quicktime audio/video codecs are not natively supported yet.
     Luckily, if you are using a x86 compatible machine (any recent PC hardware should do)
     you can install and use the original Quicktime DLLs and watch most streams
     (trailers) that can be downloaded from the net.
    </p><p>
     Possibly the most convenient way to get the Quicktime DLLs is to download
     them from the MPlayer website
     <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html" target="_top">

     The package is called "essential". Unpack it and move everything you find
     inside to <code class="filename">/usr/lib/codecs</code> (actually you can place them
     anywhere you want, e.g. someplace in your home directory, but then you'll
     have to set <em class="parameter"><code>decoder.external.win32_codecs_path</code></em> in your
     xine config file accordingly). Restart xine then and you should be
     able to watch Quicktime trailers.

      The situation with real files and streams is pretty similar to the situation
      with Quicktime Streams (see above). The newer real audio and video formats
      are only supported by using binary-only codecs which are not included in
      xine.
     </p><p>
     Possibly the most convenient way to get the Real codecs is to install
     RealPlayer 9 or RealPlayer 10 and set the
     <em class="parameter"><code>decoder.external.real_codecs_path</code></em> in your xine
     config file to the name of the directory which contains the codecs
     (look for drvc.so); it's probably something like
     <code class="filename">/opt/real/RealPlayer/codecs/</code>.  Restart xine then
     and you should be able to watch Real files/streams.
    </p><p>
     Another way to get the Real codecs is to download them from the MPlayer website
     <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html" target="_top">

      xine supports both pnm and rtsp streaming. However, digging out the actual
      pnm/rtsp url can be tricky as they're often packed into heavy JavaScript and
      HTML code on most websites. You can either use a combination of your
      browser's "save source" function and wget or use a xine browser plugin
      (currently the gxine frontend comes with a simple mozilla plugin,
      for example). When you decided to dig out the url by hand don't get fooled
      by the many redirectors that are often placed around the actual url.
      Use wget to download any http://-style urls and use less to look inside
      the downloaded .ra/.ram files where you will find the actual pnm/rtsp
      url which can be opened using xine.

     While the container format (system layer) ASF (wmv is just an alias)
     is fully supported in xine, for newer windows media 9 based streams
     you'll need to install windows binary codecs (.DLLs).
    </p><p>
     Possibly the most convenient way to get the Windows DLLs is to download
     them from the MPlayer website

        Set up and use raw devices for DVD access. Please note that the
        actual performance gain during playback is very small if any, but
        since raw devices are bypassing the kernel's buffer cache, Linux
        will not try to cache the DVDs you play. This would not be useful,
        because xine does its own caching and you usually play DVDs
        sequentially, which means you won't reuse anything from the cache.
        But the problem would be that Linux throws everything out of the
        cache that might be in there.
       </p><p>
        Raw devices should be available in linux kernel 2.4.x and there are
        patches for older kernels available from:

        </a>
       </p><p>
	 For recent kernels (2.6.x series) the raw devices are neither
	 needed nor supported anymore, so don't bother.
       </p><p>
        To use raw devices, first connect a free raw device to your dvd
        device, use something like:
        </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>raw /dev/raw1 /dev/dvd</strong></span></pre><p>

     aalib is an ascii art library. xine comes with an aalib video output

     on a remote server in your shell over ssh.
    </p><p>
     To use it make sure you have aalib installed correctly before you
     configure/build xine-lib and xine-ui. In addition to the <span class="command"><strong>xine</strong></span> binary a
     binary named <span class="command"><strong>aaxine</strong></span> should get built and installed. You can then use

     Congratulations, you seem to have an original movie audio track there.
    </p><p>
     Uhm. So you don't like it. Well, there are two things you can do:
     </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        You can enable xine's audio compressor. Most frontends have
        a settings window and in that you'll find a slider for the
        compressor setting. The values are percent values, so a
        slider setting of 200 means that xine will double the volume
        of silent parts of the movie (loud parts stay the same).
       </p><p>
        If your frontend does not have such a compression slider,
        you can pass the value with the MRL:
        </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>xine dvd:/#compression:150</strong></span></pre><p>
       </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        If you have a dolby digital (AC3) soundtrack, you can try
        to enable liba52's dynamic range compression setting
        <em class="parameter"><code>audio.a52.dynamic_range:1</code></em>
        in your xine config file (or use some gui config dialog).
       </p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="noaudio"></a>When I play this stream, xine shows video but there's no audio!</h3></div></div></div><p>
     If this happens with any video, first try a different audio driver
     (<span class="command"><strong>gxine -A oss</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>gxine -A arts</strong></span>,
     <span class="command"><strong>xine -A alsa</strong></span> …).
    </p><p>
     If this problem only occurs with one specific stream, maybe switching to
     a different audio channel (using the gui) helps. Some DVD streams have
     audio on strange channels.
    </p><p>
     If all this doesn't help, maybe you're missing an audio codec or you found
     a bug. If you decide to post your problem on the xine-user mailing list,
     make sure to include all console output xine produced and also clearly

    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="surroundsound"></a>Can xine produce 4-/5-channel surround audio output?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     Yep, it can do that using OSS or ALSA drivers, provided that the driver
     supports it. However, since xine cannot detect if there are actually speakers
     connected to the additional channels, you'll have to activate that feature manually.
    </p><p>
     You can do this either in the config dialog while xine is running (press
     the config button on the xine panel and go to the AUDIO tab) or have it
     the complicated way by editing the config file yourself which is located
     in your home directory in <code class="filename">.config/gxine</code> or
     <code class="filename">.xine</code>:
     </p><pre class="programlisting">

     xine can do that too. Pretty much the same story as for 4-/5-channel
     surround (see above). You can either use the config dialog or edit
     the config file (<code class="filename">~/.xine/config</code> or
     <code class="filename">~/.config/gxine/config</code>) yourself:

      The OSS driver is maintained by creative and can be downloaded at
      <a class="ulink" href="http://opensource.creative.com/" target="_top">http://opensource.creative.com/</a>.
      The driver package contains documentation on how to install it.
      Besides that I'd like to add the following notes.
     </p><p>
      In order to compile and install these drivers, you need a valid kernel
      configuration file. For RedHat Linux's pre-compiled kernels these
      configuration files can be found in
      <code class="filename">/usr/src/linux/configs</code>.
      After you've located the correct config file for your kernel,
      you need to copy it to <code class="filename">/usr/src/linux/.config</code>
      For example, when you run the 2.4.18-i686 kernel do :
      </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>cp /usr/src/linux/configs/kernel-2.4.18-i686.config /usr/src/linux/.config</strong></span></pre><p>
      Make sure that the emu10k1 module that is currently installed is
      not loaded. To unload the modules:
      </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>/sbin/modprobe -rv emu10k1.o ac97_codec.o</strong></span></pre><p>
      If this mentions that the device is busy, some program is
      using the driver. Some example could be a mixer application
      or sound daemon like artsd. You'll need to close down the
      applications before continuing.
      At success it should print something like:
      </p><pre class="screen">
   # delete emu10k1
   # delete ac97_codec
   # delete soundcore</pre><p>
      Run make in the directory where you unpacked the driver and follow the
      instructions printed at the end of each step.
      The last step should be:
      </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>make install-tools</strong></span></pre><p>
      As the README of the driver package mentions the SPDIF AC3
      output doesn't work by default. In the directory
      <code class="filename">utils/scripts</code> an <code class="filename">emu10k1.conf</code>
      file can be found which need to be placed in the default
      installation directory (<code class="filename">/usr/local/etc</code>).
      After this the <code class="filename">emu10k1.conf</code> needs to be modified.
      The following settings worked fine for me (I don't use the analog
      outputs of the card):
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
   CARD_IS_5_1=yes
   USE_DIGITAL_OUTPUT=yes
   ENABLE_TONE_CONTROL=yes
   AC3PASSTHROUGH=yes
   ENABLE_LIVEDRIVE_IR=no
   INVERT_REAR=no
   MULTICHANNEL=yes
   ROUTE_ALL_TO_SUB=no
   ANALOG_FRONT_BOOST=no
   SURROUND=no
   PROLOGIC=no
   ENABLE_CD_Spdif=yes
   ENABLE_OPTICAL_SPDIF=no
   ENABLE_LINE2_MIC2=no
   ENABLE_RCA_SPDIF=no
   ENABLE_RCA_AUX=no</pre><p>
      After modifying the <code class="filename">emu10k1.conf</code>,
      you need to modify your <code class="filename">/etc/modules.conf</code> and
      make sure the following lines are in there.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
   alias sound-slot-0 emu10k1
   post-install emu10k1 /usr/local/etc/emu-script</pre><p>
      After saving the changes to <code class="filename">modules.conf</code>, run
      </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>/sbin/depmod -a</strong></span></pre><p>
      Now, you're ready to load the new modules and set the correct
      options for it. To load the modules run:
      </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>/sbin/modprobe emu10k1</strong></span></pre><p>

      </p><pre class="programlisting">   audio.output.speaker_arrangement:Pass Through</pre><p>

      Connect them as follows :
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
   center pin jackplug ------|----- center pin RCA plug
                   GND     __|__    GND</pre><p>
     </p><p>
      In order to test it use a DVD with AC3 or DTS track
      start xine and select the right audio track
      from user interface or start xine as:
      </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>xine dvd:/1 -a 0</strong></span></pre><p>
      The external decoder should display something like
      "Dolby Digital" in case the selected audio track contains
      AC3 data or "DTS" in case the selected audio track
      contains DTS data. Of course stereo audio also goes
      through the SPDIF output, so the analog outputs of the
      SBLive 5.1 are not needed anymore.
     </p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="volumecontrol"></a>Changing the volume with the GUI control has no effect! What's up!?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     Some xine drivers do not support volume changing although the GUI
     will show the volume bar. Usually this is not xine's fault: aRts C
     API, for example, doesn't offer any volume property to applications.
     Similarly, with ac3 pass through it is not possible to set the volume.
    </p><p>
     Note that recently we added support to "simulate" volume in aRts by
     changing sample values on-the-fly before delivering them to the driver.
     Not as good as having access to sound card's mixer but at least users
     will not complain about lacking of volume bar anymore! :)
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="stuttering"></a>Audio is stuttering and i see a lot of "metronom: fixing sound card drift by -2115 pts" on the console output</h3></div></div></div><p>
     Might be a soundcard problem, if it only comes in longer intervals.
     Your soundcard does not keep it's sampling frequency accurately
     enough, which results in audio and video
     getting out of sync and xine has to compensate. If you see the message
     only from time to time, you might remedy it by using the resampling sync
     method. You can do this by setting the configuration entry
     <em class="parameter"><code>audio.synchronization.av_sync_method</code></em> to <em class="parameter"><code>resample</code></em>.
    </p><p>
     If you receive the metronom message more often,
     maybe switching to different drivers (alsa to oss or vise-versa)
     can help here. It has also been reported that setting the configuration
     entry <em class="parameter"><code>audio.synchronization.force_rate</code></em> to the native sampling
     rate of your soundcard (try 44100 and 48000) helps sometimes.
    </p><p>
     Another, whole different possibility is that you have some background
     process running which is messing with the clock (like some ntp client –
     chrony, ntpd, …).
    </p><p>
     Occasional messages of "fixing sound card drift" may happen on start and
     when playing a long stream (like a movie). This is normal behaviour,
     nothing to worry about.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="soundloss"></a>xine seems to lose sound arbitrarily during playback, especially with DVDs</h3></div></div></div><p>
     You are using the OSS audio output plugin, right? In order to keep video and audio
     in sync, xine regularly queries the audio driver for the amount of delay induced by
     the current length of the driver's audio buffer. Unfortunately some OSS drivers seem
     to be broken because the can return strange values here. This confuses the xine audio
     subsystem and makes it drop audio.
    </p><p>
     You should try the various settings of the
     configuration entry <em class="parameter"><code>audio.oss_sync_method</code></em>. The options
     <em class="parameter"><code>getodelay</code></em> and <em class="parameter"><code>getoptr</code></em> ask the driver and
     might therefore show the problem. But chances are that only one is broken and the other
     works, so you should try them both first, since they are the most accurate.
     The option <em class="parameter"><code>probebuffer</code></em> does not ask the driver directly but
     tries to determine the buffer length from outside. This should work with any driver
     and is the way to go, of the driver dependent methods fail.
     <em class="parameter"><code>softsync</code></em> is the least accurate and should be used only in
     emergency situations.

     Probably your hardware is simply too slow – see above for some
     hints on how to speed things up.
    </p><p>
     Another possibility is that you using a buggy Xv driver, see the next
     questions.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="bluescreen"></a>I only see a blue (or green or black) video image most of the time.</h3></div></div></div><p>
     You are either watching a very boring video (just kidding) or you are
     suffering from a bug in the Xorg 6.7 implementation of X11.
    </p><p>
     The workaround is to add the line
     </p><pre class="programlisting">   Option "XaaNoOffscreenPixmaps"</pre><p>
     in the <code class="varname">Device</code> section of your X server configuration (usually
     <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code> or <code class="filename">/etc/X11/XF86Config</code>).
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="buggyxv"></a>The image looks strange, it is shifted, cropped or shows weird lines!</h3></div></div></div><p>
     This points to a problem with the Xv extension, which is used by xine
     to display the video image. To verify this, try running xine with the XShm
     video output plugin:
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>xine -V XShm</strong></span></pre><p>
    </p><p>
     If that works fine, you just proved, that the Xv extension is buggy. xine will
     remember the last used video output plugin, so the setting will stay at XShm.
     You could simply continue using this, but XShm is a lot slower than Xv, so
     read on and see if you can get it working. Usually you should look for
     updated versions of the X driver module that belongs to your graphics card.
    </p><p>
     Other possibilites are limitations in either your X driver module or your
     graphics hardware. If your card could somehow be running out of ressources (graphics
     RAM perhaps) and displays an incorrect Xv overlay because of that, try reducing
     the display resolution and/or colour depth.
    </p><p>
     Consult the next question for more details on Xv.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="xvextension"></a>How can I make xine use the Xv extension and what drivers do I need?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     xine will normally use Xv by default if it is available. In some cases
     you might need to choose Xv playback manually (when the <code class="filename">~/.xine/config</code>
     file for some reason says that you want to use XShm):
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>xine -V Xv</strong></span></pre><p>
    </p><p>
     If this doesn't work for you, it may be possible that Xv is not present
     on your system.
    </p><p>
     First you need to install/use X.org or XFree 4.x. Once you got that you have to
     make sure the X drivers you're using are supporting Xv on your

     Usually xine discovers the screen aspect ratio by

     to make it look right. However, if that doesn't work try
     pressing "a" to manually change the aspect ratio.
    </p><p>
     If you have a wide screen monitor, make sure the X-server
     is correctly configured. The X-server must know the physical
     size of the screen, which is independent of the resolution
     being used.
    </p><p>
     For X.org, the screen size should be set in the <em class="parameter"><code>"Monitor"</code></em>
     section in the file <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code>, as in the example below:

     For XFree86, the filename is normally <code class="filename">/etc/X11/XF86Config</code>.
    </p><p>
     Where <em class="parameter"><code>DisplaySize</code></em> specifies,
     in millimeters, the physical size of the monitor's picture area.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="discardedskipped"></a>What is the difference between discarded and skipped frames?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     Sometimes xine will output a message like that:
     </p><pre class="programlisting">   200 frames delivered, XX frames skipped, YY frames discarded</pre><p>
    </p><p>
     The difference between these counters is a little subtle for the non
     developer. There are two threads running in order to display video:
     the decoder thread will deliver frames to the video output thread.
     The latter is responsible for scheduling the frames to be displayed at
     the right time.
    </p><p>
     If your system can't keep up with decoding requirements, decoder will
     deliver overdue frames. Imagine if it finished decoding the frame
     tagged for displaying at 11:30 but xine clock marks 11:31. When this
     situation is detected, xine will try to skip decoding a few frames
     to recover. Not every decoder may support this feature.
    </p><p>
     When the frame is decoded to be shown somewhere in future but the
     output thread doesn't get scheduled in time by the operating system
     to complete the operation, the frame is discarded. One cause might
     be the disk access operation, which may halt the system for a few
     miliseconds without DMA. See performance section tips above.
    </p><p>
     Note that if a decoder can't skip frames for some reason, you would
     never see frames skipped (they would be all discarded).

     This frequently happens with new Xv drivers or when switching to a
     different video card. Background is that different Xv drivers often
     use different ranges for the contrast/brightness/saturation settings.
    </p><p>
     To fix this, try opening the xine settings window and try adjusting
     the sliders for contrast, brightness and saturation.
    </p><p>
     Please note that some frontends save these settings in their config file
     so when you have found a working combination, make sure you exit
     xine cleanly so the values are saved.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="videodriver"></a>Which is the best video driver to use?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     xine supports several video drivers for outputing the image. These will
     differ on how the frames are copied to the video card memory, whether
     colourspace conversion and scaling is done in software or hardware, among
     other things. They may also differ on ease of use and stability.
    </p><p>
     Most of the time, Xv should give the users a good trade-off between
     quality, compatibility and ease of use. This is why xine tries to use
     Xv by default.
    </p><p>
     However some users may want to explore better the available hardware
     capabilities (eg. syncing frame drawing with monitor refresh).
     Also some Xv drivers contain slow copies and accessing the video card
     directly may yield performance gains.
    </p><p>
     Drivers that access hardware directly includes VIDIX (warning: requires
     root priviledges or kernel helper).
     User may try one of those, but should be warned that with root access
     they can cause the system to crash hard. The support is also limited to
     a couple of graphics cards only.
    </p><p>
     Graphic workstations like SGI have usually a good support for OpenGL.
     In that case, using OpenGL may be a better choice than XShm. However for
     most desktop systems the performance of OpenGL will be quite bad.

     Since version 1-rc3 of xine-lib supports a new method for rendering OSD
     (On Screen Display) and subtitles. This method uses a X11 extension
     called XShape that allows using screen resolution instead of
     stream resolution. It is called "unscaled" OSD because it does not
     scales with the video being played.
    </p><p>
     Suppose you are watching a 320x200 video in full screen. Normal OSD
     would be blended at 320x200 and then scaled to full screen (lets say,
     1024x768), resulting in big and ugly fonts. The unscaled overlay is
     drawn directly to screen, creating a sharper and better looking OSD.
    </p><p>
     There are side effects too. Sometimes the unscaled overlay show some
     glitch just before disappearing. Some people may be annoyed enough
     by that and might want to disable the usage of unscaled overlay
     altogether.
    </p><p>
     Unscaled OSD usage by subtitles and xine-ui is controlled by
     the following settings (<code class="filename">~/.xine/config</code> or
     <code class="filename">~/.config/gxine/config</code>):
     </p><pre class="programlisting">   gui.osd_use_unscaled:0</pre><p>
     </p><pre class="programlisting">   subtitles.separate.use_unscaled_osd:0</pre><p>
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="noosd"></a>I can't see the OSD or it leaves a black box over the image!</h3></div></div></div><p>
     If you are using xine-lib version 1-rc3 or newer, this is probably
     due buggy XV drivers that do not support
     <a class="link" href="#unscaledosd" title="What is this &quot;unscaled&quot; OSD about?">unscaled OSD</a> (the XShape
     extension) properly.
    </p><p>
     There have being reports of some ATI drivers that don't allow
     displaying anything over the video. The VIA Epia binary drivers
     is reported to leave a black box where the OSD was displayed.
    </p><p>
     The problem may be fixed by either updating the video driver,
     or disabling xine unscaled OSD support.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="overlaycolorleak"></a>Why colours of overlays/subtitles seem to be "leaking"?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     xine blends most overlays, specially the ones from DVD discs,
     directly over the image (scaled OSD). Unfortunately most codecs
     (like MPEG2) use a subsampled image format (YV12) that makes
     properly blending an interesting challenge.
    </p><p>
     In short, this is a known xine bug. There have being discussions
     on improving the blending quality but, so far, nobody implemented
     a better (scaled) overlay renderer. Contact developers if you want
     to try doing something about it.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="uglysubtitles"></a>Why external subtitles look so ugly?</h3></div></div></div><p>
    You are probably using a xine-lib version older than 1-rc3.
    Try upgrading your copy and read the
    <a class="link" href="#unscaledosd" title="What is this &quot;unscaled&quot; OSD about?">section about unscaled osd</a>.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="subtitlesoutsidevideo"></a>Why subtitles can't be displayed outside the video?</h3></div></div></div><p>
    It is possible, but older xine versions may not support it. There are two
    alternatives for rendering the subtitles outside the video image:
    </p><p>
     </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        Use the "expand" post plugin to increase frame height adding
        black bars to it. This will allow blending the subtitles
        over the black bars, since they will be part of the video now.
       </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Use <a class="link" href="#unscaledosd" title="What is this &quot;unscaled&quot; OSD about?">unscaled OSD</a>, as it
        does not requires any video to render the subtitles on.
       </p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
    Also notice that DVD overlays (including subtitles) are meant to
    be displayed in a fixed position, this is how the DVD menu
    highlighting works. xine does not support moving them.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="supportedfonts"></a>What kinds of subtitle fonts does xine use?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     xine can use two kinds of fonts:
     </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        TTF fonts
       </p><p>
        If xine is compiled with freetype library xine recognizes and uses TTF
        fonts directly.
       </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        xine fonts
       </p><p>
        This is xine's native format. It's better because the font
        generator utility implements more features than the "on the fly" TTF renderer.
       </p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
     The font for text subtitles is selected via config option
     <em class="parameter"><code>subtitles.separate.font</code></em>. You can specify xine font name
     (<em class="parameter"><code>sans</code></em>, <em class="parameter"><code>serif</code></em>, …)
     or file name of the TTF font. The directories
     <code class="filename">$prefix/share/xine/libxine1/fonts</code> and
     <code class="filename">~/.xine/fonts</code> are searched for the fonts, with
     <code class="filename">$prefix</code> being the place xine-lib was installed to.
     Usually this is <code class="filename">/usr/local</code> or <code class="filename">/usr</code>.
     TTF fonts are also searched for in the current directory.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="generatefonts"></a>How to create own xine subtitle fonts?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     xine's native subtitle fonts can be generated from TTF fonts with the
     utility <span class="command"><strong>xine-fontconv</strong></span>. It isn't compiled and installed by default but
     you can make it manually. You'll need freetype and zlib packages together with
     their versions for development plus a compiler, of course ;)
     Here's how you build <span class="command"><strong>xine-fontconv</strong></span>:
     </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        Get the source of xine-fontconv utility from the <code class="filename">misc</code>
        directory within the xine-lib sources.
       </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Compile it:
        </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>gcc xine-fontconv.c -o xine-fontconv `freetype-config --cflags --libs` -lz</strong></span></pre><p>
       </p></li></ul></div><p>
     You'll need some TTF font for generating. Characters in this font should
     cover all codepages you want supported, otherwise you'll have missing characters.
    </p><p>
     Syntax is:
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>./xine-fontconf font.ttf font_name [encoding1 [encoding2 […]]]</strong></span></pre><p>
    </p><p>
     For example default font <code class="filename">sans</code> was generated with
     following command:
     </p><pre class="screen">
   <span class="command"><strong>./xine-fontconv Aril_Bold.ttf sans iso-8859-1 iso-8859-2 iso-8859-5 \
                                      iso-8859-9 iso-8859-15 cp1250 cp1251</strong></span></pre><p>
    </p><p>
     There are displayed messages about missing characters on the screen
     during generating. It's OK if the missing characters are U+007f..U+009F.
     These characters come from iso-8859-1 and they aren't displayable.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="subencoding"></a>Encoding of external subtitles is bad. What is wrong?</h3></div></div></div><p>
     The encoding of the external subtitles is expected to be iso-8859-1 by
     default. You need to set an appropriate encoding in the config option
     <em class="parameter"><code>subtitles.separate.src_encoding</code></em>. Note that you also need
     a font which contains all characters from the given encoding.
    </p><p>
     The default font <code class="filename">sans</code> and fonts
     <code class="filename">serif</code> and <code class="filename">mono</code> cover these
     encodings:
     </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>iso-8859-1</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>iso-8859-2</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>iso-8859-5</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>iso-8859-9</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>iso-8859-15</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>windows-1250</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>windows-1251</p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="errors"></a>Error Messages: What they mean and what you can do</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="xfreecrash"></a>Starting xine crashes X, I am logged out of my desktop!</h3></div></div></div><p>
     xine itself is unable to crash X, so when your X server just shuts down or
     restarts with the login screen, there is something wrong with your X setup.
     Most common are problems with the Xv extension. Try running xine with the XShm
     video output plugin:
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>xine -V XShm</strong></span></pre><p>
    </p><p>
     If that works fine, you just proved, that the Xv extension is buggy. xine will
     remember the last used video output plugin, so the setting will stay at XShm.
     You could simply continue using this, but XShm is a lot slower than Xv, so
     consult the <a class="link" href="#xvextension" title="How can I make xine use the Xv extension and what drivers do I need?">section on Xv</a> and see if you can
     get it working. Usually you should look for updated versions of the X driver
     module that belongs to your graphics card.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="audiodrivererr"></a>Starting xine fails with complains about audio drivers/devices!</h3></div></div></div><p>
     You can select the audio driver using the -A option. So try:
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>xine -A null</strong></span></pre><p>
     If you have ALSA drivers installed, try:
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>xine -A alsa</strong></span></pre><p>
     If you run ESD (not recommended), try:
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>xine -A esd</strong></span></pre><p>
     If you run artsd, try:
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>xine -A arts</strong></span></pre><p>
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="novideoportfound"></a>"no video port found"</h3></div></div></div><p>
     You got the Xv extension, but your video card driver doesn't support it.
     First try to find a driver that does support Xv on your hardware (check
     your graphics card vendor). If your driver has Xv support but you can't
     get it working, try at a lower resolution (1024x768 is enough even for
     anamorphic DVDs).
    </p><p>
     If all that fails, you can still use plain X11/XShm:
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>gxine -V XShm foo.vob</strong></span></pre><p>
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="unabletoopendvddrive"></a>"Unable to open dvd drive (/dev/dvd)"</h3></div></div></div><p>
     You probably don't have /dev/dvd (check that). If so, simply create a
     link /dev/dvd that points to your DVD device. Something like…
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>ln -s hdc /dev/dvd</strong></span></pre><p>
     … should do the job. Also make sure you have read and write access on
     the device the symlink points to.
     See the <a class="link" href="#dvdplayback" title="How do I play back DVDs with xine?">dvd playback section</a>
     for more information.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="status0x51"></a>My drive doesn't work and the kernel says "status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }"</h3></div></div></div><p>
     This error can be fixed by recompiling your kernel with the option
     "Use multi-mode by default" enabled in the IDE settings.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="demuxerror0000"></a>"demux error! 00 00 00 (should be 0x000001)"</h3></div></div></div><p>
     Probably xine can't access your input source. Most commonly this happens
     when you're trying to play locked/encrypted DVDs. Remember that xine
     can't play such DVDs out-of-the box for legal reasons (see above).
    </p><p>
     If it is legal where you live, you can try to install libdvdcss. Once
     you have done that and re-start xine, it should automatically detect
     and use it to play back encrypted DVDs.
    </p><p>
     Another reason could be that your (RPC-2) DVD drive isn't set up
     for the right region (see above).
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ossfailed"></a>"audio driver 'oss' failed, using null driver instead"</h3></div></div></div><p>
     First of all, make sure that your OSS Audio drivers are working (i.e.
     you can play music with other software). Maybe you're using alsa?
     If so, try <span class="command"><strong>gxine -A alsa</strong></span> to see if this helps.
    </p><p>
     The most common reason for oss not working is that some other program is accesing
     your audio device. If you're using linux, the command <span class="command"><strong>fuser /dev/dsp</strong></span>
     should give you the PID of the process.
    </p><p>
     If you are using GNOME, chances are that this is caused by ESD. Now you
     have two possibilities. Either deactivate ESD (temporarily) by right
     clicking on the sound monitor applet and selecting "Place Esound in
     standby" or just kill it. Then xine will use OSS audio output. The other
     method is to make xine use ESD for audio output with:
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>gxine -A esd</strong></span></pre><p>
     This may result in worse playback – exact syncronization is not possible
     with esd, so using oss should be preferred.
    </p><p>
     If you are using KDE, there is the possibility that the aRts sound
     daemon is currently running and thus blocking your sound device. You
     can check that by starting the aRts control (in your KDE menu it should
     be under Multimedia). If it is running, you can either use the aRts
     audio output plugin:
     </p><pre class="screen">   <span class="command"><strong>gxine -A arts</strong></span></pre><p>
     Or you suspend the aRts daemon by checking the appropriate option in
     your aRts control. (recommended)
    </p><p>
     Newer versions of arts have an auto-suspend mode – this can lead to
     some nondeterministic behaviour of xine if it is set up to use
     the audio device directly. Using arts is recommended in that case;
     however, you will lose the ability to do four/five channel audio output.

     This is a performance related problem.
     If you have a fast computer and this message is shown from time to

     OK, yes, that shouldn't happen and you're upset. We can understand that.
     But, to help you and of course to fix this, we need some information.
     So, let's go through the checklist and maybe prepare a nice bug report
     for the <a class="ulink" href="http://bugs.xine-project.org/" target="_top">xine bug tracker</a>:
     </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        Did xine really crash (segfault) or did it hang (deadlock)?
       </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

        did and when you do it again it crashes again?)
       </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Is that a specific media file or format which crashes xine? (Have you
        tried other files types?)
       </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Check the console output (and include it in a bug report), maybe earlier
        there is some output that points to the problem.
       </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Your X server just froze on you? unfortunately that's a known problem
        with some chipsets and drivers (most commonly Savage chipsets) when
        using Xv. You might want to try running <span class="command"><strong>gxine -V XShm</strong></span>
        to see if the problem is related to the Xv driver. This will unfortunately
        be much slower, as lots of things are now done in software instead of
        hardware scaling/colour space conversion.
       </p><p>
        Maybe at the time you read this, there's an X upgrade which fixes
        this for the Savage driver. If that works for you, please notify the xine crew at
        <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:xine-user@lists.sourceforge.net">xine-user@lists.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;</code>, so they can update this FAQ!
       </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Even though we try to make each release as bug free as possible, xine is
        still under heavy development (nice excuse, isn't it? *grin*).

        If you write to the <a class="ulink" href="http://bugs.xine-project.org/" target="_top">xine bug tracker</a>
