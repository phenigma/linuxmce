  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * debian/patches/00_disable_v4l1_probing.patch
    - The hald-probe-video4linux prober supports both v4l1 and v4l2. Support
      for v4l1 has been removed from Linux kernel 2.6.38. Instead of
      disabling the prober altogether, #ifdef the v4l1 parts when building on a
      newer kernel. This partially reverts 00upstream_video4linux_check.patch.

  * Use D-Bus activation to start hal
    - Remove debian/hal.{init,default}.
    - Add D-Bus system service file debian/org.freedesktop.Hal.service.
    - Add systemd service file debian/hal.service which allows to manage hal
      via systemd.
    - Install both via debian/hal.install, create a symlink for hal.service so
      it is enabled by default when using systemd.
    - debian/hal.preinst: Remove init.d/default/rc.d files on upgrade.
    - debian/hal.postinst: When being triggered by an .fdi file update, query
      D-Bus to get the main pid. If hald is running kill the process and
      restart it via D-Bus activation.
    - debian/hal.postinst: Restart hal on upgrades.
    - debian/hal.prerm: Stop hal on remove.
    - debian/patches/02_libhal_dont_check_running.patch: In libhal_ctx_init(),

hal (0.5.13-5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Disable PolicyKit and ConsoleKit support in hal. GNOME uses DK-disks for
    mounting (removable) devices nowadays and KDE never made use of the
    PolicyKit support in HAL. (Closes: #549505, #526854)
  * debian/rules
    - Pass --disable-policy-kit and --disable-console-kit to

    - Drop policykit dependency and demote consolekit to Recommends. We still
      want to install consolekit by default for its D-Bus "at_console"
      functionality.
    - Keymap handling was disabled in 0.5.13-4 as this is done by udev
      nowadays. Bump dependency on udev to (>= 143) to make sure we actually
      have a udev version which supports keymap remapping. (Closes: #555050)

    - Stop installing the PolicyKit policy files.
  * debian/hal.manpages

      used in the D-Bus policy file.
  * debian/patches/10-no-polkit-policy-file-validate-check.patch
    - Drop this patch, obsolete.
  * debian/patches/01_at_console.patch

  * Add support for GNU/Hurd. (Closes: #552386)
    - debian/patches/22_fix_unconditional_usage_of_PATH_MAX.patch: Use
      HAL_PATH_MAX as PATH_MAX is not defined on GNU/Hurd.
    - debian/control: Disable Linux-only dependencies.
    - debian/hal.init: Hurd's proc translator does not provide /proc/$PID/root

      hal-setup-keymap binary that is necessary for the multimedia key
      re-mapping support.
    - Add a Recommends: libsmbios-bin [i386 amd64]. The libsmbios-bin
      package ships the dellWirelessCtl utility which is required for the
      RF kill switch support on DELL laptops.
    - Add a Depends: pm-utils. Beginning with this release we will only
      support pm-utils as suspend infrastructure.

      hal umount helper.

  * debian/control:
    - Add an explicit build dependency on docbook-xml so we don't fail on
      buildds without network access.

  [ Sjoerd Simons ]
  * debian/hal-unmount.sh: Always run pumount/umount if a block device is
    removed, not only when it's mounted. This ensure that dm devices can be
    properly deconfigured by pumount.

    - debian/control: Build-Depend on docbook-utils and libxml2-utils.
