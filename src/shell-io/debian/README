The Debian Package shell-io
----------------------------

This package contains utilities to facilitate I/O operations in shell scripts.

== Included commands:

- fdread
  Read content from a file descriptor and display it unprocessed
- fdreadhex
  Read content from a file descriptor and display its hex representation
- fdreadenc
  Read content from a file descriptor and display it with non-printable
  characters in encoded form.
- fdwrite
  Take a string in encoded form, decode it, and write it to a file descriptor.

== Usage:

Var=$(fdread $fd)
Var=$(fdreadhex $fd)
Var=$(fdreadenc $fd)
fdwrite $fd "string"
ReadyFDs=$(fdselect $sec $msec $fd1 [$fd2...])

== Encoding of non-printable characters:

Characters with ASCII code below 32 or above 127 are encoded as %XX, where XX
is the hex encoding. The percent sign is doubled when it is the wanted character.

== Where do the file descriptors come from?

You open them using "exec" in the shell script, and they are inherited by child
processes, and that's why this works.
