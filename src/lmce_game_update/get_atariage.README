The AtariAGE scripts are designed to grab image data from Atari Age for snapshots to be placed in the Snapshot package.

It is intended to be run as part of a pipe. In a directory of ROMs (as many as possible), do 

ls | get_rom_names | get_atariage_info_a2600 

get_rom_names tries to parse rom names and get just the game name, which can be passed to get_atariage_info_a2600. If matched, a JPEG picture will be downloaded to the current directory.
