These are the modules included in the ivtv suite.

The ivtv module is the main one and it will automatically detect your
environment and load additional modules as needed.

Usually:
	modprobe ivtv
will work fine.

In general you don't need the parameters below. I repeat: in general you
do not need the parameters below. Really.

For discussion of the differences between NTSC/PAL/SECAM, as well as a list of
the sub-types of PAL, see:

Where "uses I2C_CLIENT_INSMOD" is mentioned, the module supports the five
standard options from include/i2c.h:

probe           - List of adapter,address pairs to scan additionally
probe_range     - List of adapter,start-addr,end-addr triples to scan
                  additionally
ignore          - List of adapter,address pairs not to scan
ignore_range    - List of adapter,start-addr,end-addr triples not to scan
force           - List of adapter,address pairs to boldly assume to be present


ivtv
====
This is the iTVC15 driver

parameter: tuner
Tuner type selection
Default value is autodetected from the eeprom
The value should be from driver/tuner.h; check that file for the latest list

parameter: radio
Enable or disable the radio.
Use only if autodetection fails. 0 = disable, 1 = enable

Various *_buffers options (units are MB), can be overridden to allocate
more/less memory to the driver

option			default		max
------			-------		---
yuv_buffers		2		32
mpg_buffers		4		16
vbi_buffers		2		16
pcm_buffers		2		16
dec_mpg_buffers		1		1
dec_yuv_buffers		1		1
dec_vbi_buffers		1		1
dec_osd_buffers		1		2

parameter: cardtype
Specify card type. Only use this option if your card is not detected properly
	 1 = WinTV PVR 250
	 2 = WinTV PVR 350
	 3 = WinTV PVR-150 or PVR-500
	 4 = AVerMedia M179
	 5 = YUAN MPG600/Kuroutoshikou iTVC16-STVLP
	 6 = YUAN MPG160/Kuroutoshikou iTVC15-STVLP
	 7 = YUAN PG600/DIAMONDMM PVR-550 (CX Falcon 2)
	 8 = Adaptec AVC-2410
	 9 = Adaptec AVC-2010
	10 = NAGASE TRANSGEAR 5000TV
	11 = AOpen VA2000MAX-STN6
	12 = YUAN MPG600GR/Kuroutoshikou CX23416GYC-STVLP
	13 = I/O Data GV-MVP/RX
	14 = I/O Data GV-MVP/RX2E
        Default: Autodetect

parameter: ivtv_debug
Debug level (bitmask). Default: errors only
 IVTV_DEBUG_ERR   (1 << 0)
 IVTV_DEBUG_INFO  (1 << 1)
 IVTV_DEBUG_API   (1 << 2)
 IVTV_DEBUG_DMA   (1 << 3)
 IVTV_DEBUG_IOCTL (1 << 4)
 IVTV_DEBUG_I2C   (1 << 5)
 IVTV_DEBUG_IRQ   (1 << 6)
 IVTV_DEBUG_DEC   (1 << 7)
e.g. "modprobe ivtv ivtv_debug=255" gives full debugging
     "modprobe ivtv ivtv_debug=3" gives errors and info

parameter: pal
Set PAL standard: B, G, H, D, K, I, M, N, Nc
Default: Autodetect

parameter: ntsc
Set NTSC standard: M, J
Default: Autodetect

parameter: secam
Set SECAM standard: B, G, H, D, K, L, LC
Default: Autodetect

parameter: ivtv_first_minor
Set minor assigned to first card. Don't worry about this unless you have
multiple cards and are really picky about the /dev/video* numbering.

parameter: yuv_fixup
If nonzero, sets an internal "yuv_fixup" variable. This is possibly
dead/orphaned code; nothing appears to make use of it.

parameter: ivtv_dynbuf
Specify using Dynamic Buffers: 0 = No, 1 = Yes, default No

parameter: ivtv_efw
parameter: ivtv_dfw
Set the filename from which to read the Hauppauge hardware's encoder and decoder
firmware, respectively.

ivtv-fb
=======
This module allows your ivtv device (PVR350) to act as a framebuffer (e.g. for X
or as a console). You can then use the standard Xorg/XFree86 fbdev but *much*
better performance is obtained by using the ivtvfbdev from FIXME.

parameter: ivtv_fb_card_id
ID number of ivtv card to use as framebuffer device (0-7)
