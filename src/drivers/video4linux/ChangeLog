	* cx88-tvaudio.c:
	- some clean up in cx88-tvaudio.c
	- replaced hex values when writing to AUD_CTL to EN_xx for better reading.
	- Moved writing to register AUD_CTL from "set_audio_start" to
	  "set_audio_finish".
	- Changed the order of writing Lang2 to work correctly
	- Added an "#if 0"  to comment out existing code in "cx88_get_stereo"
	  because simply reading from register "AUD_STATUS" is _not_ enough to
	  auto-detect btsc-sap, dual-fm-stereo or nicam. It is simply not working.
	- Using "EN_A2_AUTO_STEREO" does not work.
	- Allow select by hand between Mono, Lang1, Lang2 and Stereo.
	- *Bad side effect* is now if I'm selecting for example stereo but it is not
	  supported from tv-channel I'm currently receiving loud noise.

	  For radio seeing a stereo signal but sending mono the driver
	  can simply set this:
