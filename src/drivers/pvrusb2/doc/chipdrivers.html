<H2><A NAME="Overview">Overview</A></H2>

<P>As previously mentioned <A HREF="setup.html#Modules">here</A> on
the <A HREF="setup.html">setup.html</A> page, the pvrusb2 driver
itself outsources much of the actual work to various chip-level
drivers.  A chip-level driver is just a kernel module that is a part
of the v4l core within the kernel.  This type of architecture exists
because frequently the same chips are used across multiple different
types of video capture cards, and by collecting the chip-level drivers
into the v4l core itself, the complexity of each driver can be reduced
and redundant code eliminated.  The pvrusb2 driver need only
coordinate the operation of the chip-level drivers and provide a
communications path from each chip-level driver back to the chip that
it is controlling.</P>

<P>If you are running a recent Linux kernel version, i.e. 2.6.15 or
later, then the chip-level drivers that are a part of the included v4l
core with those kernels should be sufficient to work with the pvrusb2
driver.  For older kernel versions however you may need to replace one
or more of the chip-level drivers before the pvrusb2 driver will
function correctly.  While the standalone pvrusb2 driver tries hard to
work with the different versions of chip-level drivers found in
various environments, it can't handle everything.  For example, the
tuner.ko you have in your kernel might not recognize the particular
tuner type in your device.  In cases like that you will have to
replace tuner.ko with a version that works better.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Survey">Chip-level driver survey</A></H2>

<P>The exact set of chip-level drivers required by the pvrusb2 driver
will depend on the hardware type you have (i.e. 24xxx, 29xxx, or
Gotview) and possible also its tuner type.  The following is a list of
these chip-level drivers:</P>

<DL>

<DT><TT>cx25840.ko</TT></DT> <DD>This is a driver for the cx2584x
series of video and audio processor chips, which is used by 24xxx and
Gotview hardware.  You do not need this for 29xxx hardware.  This
driver did not appear in the kernel until 2.6.15.</DD>

<DT><TT>msp3400.ko</TT></DT> <DD>This is a driver for the msp34xx
series of audio processors, which is used by 29xxx hardware.  You
don't need it for 24xxx or Gotview hardware.</DD>

<DT><TT>saa7115.ko</TT></DT> <DD>This is a driver for the saa7115
video digitizer chip, which is used by 29xxx hardware.  You don't need
it for 24xxx or Gotview hardware.  Unfortunately this driver did not
appear in the kernel until 2.6.15.  If you are using an older kernel
you will definitely have to supply a replacement (keep reading).</DD>

<DT><TT>tda9887.ko</TT></DT> <DD>This is a driver for the tda9887
demodulator chip.  Some PVR USB2 devices don't seem to need this
driver (from looking at the datasheet for this part it's possible to
hardwire it for NTSC operation).  There are a number of issues with
this module; the reader is advised to read <A
HREF="tda9887.html">tda9887.html</A> for further information.  Note
that more recent V4L tuner.ko modules include tda9887 internally in
which case there won't be a separate td9887 module - in which case you
can ignore everything said here.</DD>

<DT><TT>tuner.ko</TT></DT> <DD>This is a generic tuner driver; it
deals with the RF side of a TV capture device.  If you were to examine
the inside of your PVR USB2 device, this would be the driver that
controls the big &quot;metal can&quot; part of the circuit board.</DD>

<DT><TT>tveeprom.ko</TT></DT> <DD>This is a module which knows how to
interpret the contents of a Hauppauge EEPROM.  This is not used for
Gotview hardware.  All Hauppauge devices include an EEPROM, and its
contents tell us things like the serial number of the device, the
supported video standards, and the type of installed tuner (which is
translated and passed to <TT>tuner.ko</TT>).  Unlike the other
chip-level drivers which attach to the driver at run-time, this driver
is unusual in that it has to be bound to <TT>pvrusb2.ko</TT> at the
time <TT>pvrusb2.ko</TT> is loaded into the kernel.  This is because
we have to directly call into it to do the translation, which forces
the module loader to immediately resolve the symbolic reference.  This
causes a number of subtle issues; the reader is advised read <A
HREF="eeprom.html">eeprom.html</A> for further information if trouble
is suspected here.</DD>

<DT><TT>wm8775.ko</TT></DT> <DD>This is a driver for the wm8775 audio
digitizer chip.  It is used only for 24xxx hardware and only comes
into play if you select composite or s-video input - it is used to
sample the line level audio input into a bit stream.  You don't need
this for 29xxx or Gotview hardware.  Also, this driver did not appear
in the kernel until 2.6.15.</DD>

<DT><TT>cs53l32a.ko</TT></DT> <DD>This is a driver for the cs53l32a
audio switching chip.  It is used only for OnAir hardware.  You don't
need this for other hardware.  Also, this driver did not become usable
for the pvrusb2 driver until kernel 2.6.17 (it may exist in older
kernels, but only using a different incompatible API).</DD>

</DL>

<P>Here is a summary of which chip-level drivers need to be available,
based on hardware type:</P>

<P>For 29xxx hardware:</P>
<blockquote><code>
msp3400.ko<BR>
saa7115.ko<BR>
tda9887.ko<BR>
tuner.ko<BR>
tveeprom.ko<BR>
</code></blockquote>

<P>For 24xxx hardware:</P>
<blockquote><code>
cx25840.ko<BR>
tda9887.ko<BR>
tuner.ko<BR>
tveeprom.ko<BR>
wm8775.ko<BR>
</code></blockquote>

<P>For Gotview hardware:</P>
<blockquote><code>
cx25840.ko<BR>
tda9887.ko<BR>
tuner.ko<BR>
tveeprom.ko<BR>
</code></blockquote>

<P>For OnAir hardware:</P>
<blockquote><code>
saa7115.ko<BR>
tda9887.ko<BR>
tuner.ko<BR>
cs53l32a.ko<BR>
</code></blockquote>

<P>You <em>might not</em> actually need <TT>tda9887.ko</TT> but it is
impossible to know for sure until the tuner type has been discovered
by the driver.</P>

<P>If you are running a recent enough (i.e. 2.6.15 or later) kernel
and it has been properly configured (see the <A
HREF="setup.html#Prerequisites">prerequisites</A> section of <A
HREF="setup.html">setup.html</A>) then you don't need to do anything
else.  The pvrusb2 driver will automatically load the appropriate
kernel modules when the hardware is plugged in.  If you are however
running an older kernel or you find for some reason that you need to
replace one or more of these chip-level drivers, then read on.</P>

<P>Note that if you are running the in-V4L version of the pvrusb2
driver (i.e. you are building the official V4L repository and
therefore getting the pvrusb2 driver as part of it), then you are
using all the official v4l chip-level drivers in their latest versions
already.  In that case, you can disregard the rest of this page.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Situations">Situations requiring chip-level driver
replacement</A></H2>

<H4><TT>cx25840.ko</TT> and <TT>wm8775.ko</TT></H4>

<P>The absence of <TT>cx25840.ko</TT> (and <TT>wm8775.ko</TT> for
24xxx hardware) from the kernel for versions older than 2.6.15 is the
reason why it is difficult to run 24xxx or Gotview hardware with older
kernel releases.  It is not impossible, but I've never tried it and I
don't recommend it.  However if you can locate and install replacement
versions of those modules, then in theory it should still work for
you.</P>

<H4><TT>saa7115.ko</TT></H4>

<P>The absence of <TT>saa7115.ko</TT> from the kernel for versions
older than 2.6.15 causes an issue for running 29xxx hardware for older
kernel releases.  This is not as bad as the 24xxx / Gotview case
because there is a replacement supplied with the pvrusb2 driver
snapshot.</P>

<H4><TT>tveeprom.ko</TT> and <TT>tuner.ko</TT></H4>

<P>Another problem that can arise with older kernels is that
<TT>tuner.ko</TT> might not know how to handle your tuner type or that
<TT>tveeprom.ko</TT> might not map the type correctly.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>There are on the order of 100 different tuner types that
can reside inside that metal can, and Hauppauge likes swapping them
out without any other clue beyond what is in the EEPROM.  Identifying
the proper type is in fact the primary reason why reading that EEPROM
is so important - there's simply no other way for the pvrusb2 driver
to correctly determine the actual type of tuner your device is using.
Back before I began work on this driver, Aurelien's version of this
driver was hardcoded for about 5 tuner types.  My tuner type wasn't in
that list, and it was one of the first things I attacked in this
driver...</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The pvrusb2 driver figures out the tuner type by retrieving it via
<TT>tveeprom.ko</TT> and then passing that information to
<TT>tuner.ko</TT>.  The type encoded into the EEPROM is a
Hauppauge-specific ID, so <TT>tveeprom.ko</TT> has to also map that ID
to a v4l-generic tuner type value before handing the result back to
the pvrusb2 driver.  Some older versions of <TT>tveeprom.ko</TT> may
not have a map entry for your tuner type.  Here's an example of what a
tveeprom bad mapping will look like in the system log:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>tveeprom: tuner = Philips FM1236 MK3 (idx = 58, type = 4)</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In the above case, <TT>tveeprom.ko</TT> recognized a Hauppauge type
58 tuner, but mapped that value to v4l type 4.  Unfortunately type 4
in v4l means &quot;unknown&quot;.  If you see a message like this in
the system log where the value for &quot;type =&quot; is 4, then you
have a bad mapping and you'll have to replace <TT>tveeprom.ko</TT>.
This situation in fact is a problem for the <TT>tveeprom.ko</TT>
included with kernel versions 2.6.11 or older.</P>

<P>Also, some older versions of <TT>tuner.ko</TT> may have incorrect
information for the declared type.  This is a less common problem, but
generally it's probably safest to also replace <TT>tuner.ko</TT> when
replacing <TT>tveeprom.ko</TT> since if <TT>tveeprom.ko</TT> decided
the type was unknown then it's possible that the needed type just
simply might not be present in <TT>tuner.ko</TT>.</P>

<H4><TT>msp3400.ko</TT></H4>

<P>Another more subtle problem you might encounter has to deal with
audio demodulation in NTSC territory.  Until recently,
<TT>msp3400.ko</TT> failed to correct decode SAP or mono broadcasts.
This went unnoticed for a long time because (a) the original
<TT>msp3400.ko</TT> author did not live in NTSC territory, and (b)
those of us in NTSC tend to only use stereo audio anyway.  But if you
want SAP and/or mono, you will need to replace <TT>msp3400.ko</TT>,
and in this case the only choices for replacements are in the 2.6.17
(or later) kernel or in the V4L master repository (in both cases
you'll probably end up upgrading everything due to other dependencies
between msp3400 and the surrounding environment).</P>

<P>There is a known issue involving audio volume in the pvrusb2
driver.  The default volume setting is 100% which frequently causes
distortion.  (Just lower the volume.)  The reason I mention this here
is that some versions of <TT>msp3400.ko</TT> scaled their volume
setting so that 100% didn't distort.  Current versions don't scale
anymore, but you should be aware of this side-effect when trying
different versions of this chip-level driver.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Replacements">Replacing chip-level drivers</A></H2>

<P>For the in-V4L pvrusb2 driver, there's nothing to replace since
everything needed is already in the V4L repository you would be
building from and those are the latest versions.</P>

<P>For the standalone pvrusb2 driver, if you find you need to replace
one or more chip-level drivers, you have three choices:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Just use the in-V4L version of the pvrusb2 driver.  Said another
way, don't use the standalone pvrusb2 driver - go get the official v4l
repository and build it instead, which includes the in-V4L version of
the pvrusb2 driver.</LI>

<P>This &quot;just go get the official v4l repository&quot; choice is
not really a chip-level driver replacement so much as it is a
&quot;give up and go run the latest V4L&quot; sort of choice.  As
mentioned elsewhere, this is an elephant gun solution.  But you gain
the advantage that it should work cleanly with just about any 2.6.x
kernel version - and if you're running 24xxx or Gotview hardware this
is really your only choice for older kernels.  If you choose to go
this route, then the procedure you need is outside the scope of this
documentation.  What you need to do is go to <A
HREF="http://linuxtv.org">linuxtv.org</A> and follow their process for
downloading and building the official v4l repository.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If you do go the &quot;official v4l&quot; route, you might
also want to try <A
HREF="http://linuxtv.org/hg/~mcisely/v4l-dvb">my</A> v4l repository
there in lieu of the master repo.  When I make changes to the
standalone driver, I also generate and push a corresponding changeset
for the in-V4L driver.  These changes are pushed into <A
HREF="http://linuxtv.org/hg/~mcisely/v4l-dvb">http://linuxtv.org/hg/~mcisely/v4l-dvb</A>,
and once I'm convinced it is stable there, then the changes are pulled
up to the master repository (<A
HREF="http://linuxtv.org/hg/v4l-dvb">http://linuxtv.org/hg/v4l-dvb</A>)
by the v4l maintainer.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>Install an ivtv distribution appropriate for your desired kernel
and use the chip level drivers supplied with it.</LI>

<P>Many of the chip-level drivers used by the pvrusb2 had their
genesis as part of the ivtv driver.  As such, you might find that the
chip-level drivers supplied there as part of the ivtv driver are more
recent and more stable.  You can find the ivtv driver project at <A
HREF=" http://ivtvdriver.org">ivtvdriver.org</A>.  Just grab an
appropriate snapshot there and install it; the pvrusb2 driver should
be able to operate fine with it.</P>

<LI>Build the chip-level drivers bundled with the pvrusb2 driver.</LI>

<P>The standalone pvrusb2 driver snapshot includes a few of the
chip-level drivers.  These are directly ripped from ivtv, from roughly
back around September 2005.  You can find them in the <tt>ivtv</tt>
subdirectory of the snapshot.  Building them is the same procedure as
described <A HREF="setup.html#Compilation">here</A> for building the
pvrusb2 driver itself, just the directory has changed.  For example:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>export KREL=`uname -r`<BR>
export KDIR=/lib/modules/$KREL/source<BR>
make --directory ivtv<BR></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Note that these chip-level drivers are considered to be a bit
outdated now, and in fact they won't even compile for kernel versions
2.6.16 or later.  You definitely do NOT want to use them unless your
kernel is 2.6.15 or older.  However they are known to work well for
those older kernels and it's certainly easier than installing all of
ivtv or sucking down the entire V4L repository if you just need to
replace some of the chip-level drivers.</P>

</UL>

<P>You might have noticed by now that dealing with these chip-level
drivers might get tricky.  Perhaps at this point you might reconsider
moving to a later kernel version?...</P>

<P>Regardless of how you choose to replace the modules, there are some
other caveats you need to be careful about for actually installing
them.  You see, in this case you are potentially replacing kernel
modules that were already present in your kernel so you need to be
sure that the replacement actually replaces what you expect.  To that
end, here are some important tips:</P>

<UL>

<LI>You need to remove or otherwise disable the existing copy of the
module you are replacing.  For example, if you copy a new
<TT>tuner.ko</TT> into your kernel module tree and you still leave the
original <TT>tuner.ko</TT> in <TT>kernel/drivers/media/video</TT>
untouched, then the module loader might still load the old version
without you knowing it.  This means that you must do something to the
old module file.  If you don't want to simple remove or overwrite it,
then you should rename it with a different file extension so that the
module loader won't see it anymore.  My personal preference is just to
tack on a &quot;<TT>.disabled</TT>&quot; extension.  If you aren't
sure where the original module is, try a find command to locate it.
For example to find <TT>tuner.ko</TT>:</LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>find /lib/modules -name tuner.ko -print</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>If the module you are replacing is already loaded into the kernel,
then you need to unload it before your replacement module will have
any effect.  This is a common mistake.  Just because the module loader
might have automatically loaded <TT>tuner.ko</TT> for you doesn't mean
that it will be automatically unloaded!  Use &quot;<TT>modprobe
-r</TT>&quot; or &quot;<TT>rmmod</TT>&quot; to unload it.  To
determine if the module you are replacing is already loaded, run
<TT>lsmod</TT> and look for it in the list.  Continuing with our
<TT>tuner.ko</TT> example:</LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>lsmod | grep tuner</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>The pvrusb2 driver will auto-load its required chip-level drivers
when the hardware is plugged in.  But if you replace a module and
therefore also unload it from the kernel, you'll need to load it again
afterwards (e.g. execute &quot;<TT>modprobe tuner</TT>&quot;) if there
is a running pvrusb2 instance with active hardware.  The pvrusb2
driver will notice when the module reappears and should usually
reconfigure it correctly (thus you can replace these chip-level
drivers on-the-fly).</LI>

<LI>If you are installing a module that wasn't previously present,
e.g. <TT>saa7115.ko</TT> in an old kernel, you need to also tell the
module loader about it the first time you install it.  After you copy
in the new module, run &quot;<TT>depmod -a</TT>&quot;; this will cause
the module loader to rescan the tree and rebuild its database of known
modules.</LI>

<LI>Kernel modules (i.e. our chip-level drivers) can be placed
anywhere in the kernel's module tree for your running kernel; the
loader doesn't care.  So long as you place it somewhere under
<TT>/lib/modules/`uname -r`</TT> then things should be fine.</LI>
