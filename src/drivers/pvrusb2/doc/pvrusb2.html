<H2><A NAME="Contact">Contacting People / Discussion List</A></H2>

<P>If you wish to contact me, my e-mail address is spelled out at the
top of this page.</P>

<P>There is also a pvrusb2 e-mail discussion list, hosted here at this
site.  This is a mailman-operated list, so you can subscribe,
unsubscribe, access your subscription, scan archives, etc via the web.
(You can also initiate a subscription by sending a message to
&lt;pvrusb2-subscribe at isely dot net&gt;.)  Any pvrusb2 relevant
topic there is fair game.  Posting to the pvrusb2 list is limited to
just subscribers, but I encourage you to subscribe to the list.  The
main web page for the discussion list can be found <A
HREF="http://www.isely.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pvrusb2">here</A>.</P>


<P>Note also for those who use chat systems, the IRC channel #pvrusb2
exists on freenode.  When I'm logged in, I tend to idle there, with
the handle &quot;mcisely&quot;.  I also have that same handle on AIM,
jabber, googletalk, and Yahoo (but not on MSN).  Unfortunately these
days I have a hard time actually being &quot;there&quot; and IRC
doesn't really have a good means to show when one is away.  Feel free
to ping me if you'd like, but if I fail to answer then I'm probably
elsewhere - in which case e-mail is a better bet to find me.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Overview">Overview</A></H2>

<P>The pvrusb2 driver described on this site is a Linux driver which
operates a particular class of USB-hosted analog TV tuners that
include hardware mpeg encoding capability.  A <A
HREF="http://linuxtv.org/">video4linux</A> (V4L) interface is
currently presented to the application.  In addition to the V4L
interface, there is also a sysfs interface and a DVB interface
(currently just for streaming digital tv on hybrid devices).</P>

<P>Another driver similar to the pvrusb2 driver is the <A
HREF="http://ivtvdriver.org">ivtv</A> driver.  The primary difference
between ivtv and pvrusb2 is that ivtv targets PCI-hosted tuners while
the pvrusb2 driver focuses on USB-hosted tuners.  Though the two
drivers share a lot of common logic and internal hardware (all
physically shared via the V4L core), ultimately their control pathway
is different enough that the two drivers must be, well, two different
drivers.</P>

<H3>Hardware Summary</H3>

<P>The pvrusb2 driver is designed for USB-hosted TV tuners which
contain a Conexant cx23416 (or similar) mpeg encoder chip.  This
encompasses a class of USB analog and hybrid tuners which advertise
the ability to encode video and audio into an mpeg stream - directly
in the hardware - an ideal feature for use in PVR applications such as
MythTV.</P>

<P>A USB-hosted tuner is an external device, connected to the PC
through a USB connection.  A USB 2.0 high-speed capable bus is usually
expected but an mpeg compressed stream configured with default bit
rates can in fact work acceptably well even over a USB 1.1 full-speed
pathway.  Compared to PCI card based TV tuners, a USB-hosted TV tuner
is suitable for laptop, xbox, or embedded device applications where
there would otherwise not be a PCI slot available.  The cx23416 mpeg
encoder chip consumes more power than can be supplied over the USB
cable so one should expect these types of tuners to always require an
external power brick.</P>

<P>The pvrusb2 driver was originally written with the Hauppauge PVR
USB2 device in mind (hence the name, see further), however the PVR
USB2 is actually a very popular evolution of a common reference
design.  There are other (less common) variations that exist from
other vendors.  The following subsections summarize currently
supported devices.</P>

<H4>Hauppauge WinTV PVR USB2</H4>

<P>The most common pvrusb2-driven device is the <CITE>Hauppauge <A
HREF="http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/products/data_pvrusb2.html">WinTV
PVR USB2</A></CITE>, which is a USB 2.0 hosted TV Tuner.  Though this
device is no longer for sale new within the US (thank you,
FCC... NOT), at this moment (March 2009) you might still find an
example at <A
HREF="http://www.pricegrabber.com/search_getprod.php/masterid=3017802">pricegrabber</A>.
This device is an analog tuner, but it has a hardware mpeg encoder,
which makes it ideal for use in PVR applications.  Functionally, the
&quot;PVR USB2&quot; device is very similar to Hauppauge's line of
&quot;PVR-nnn&quot; PCI based tuner cards - except this device of
course uses USB instead of PCI.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Please note carefully the name above: <CITE>WinTV PVR
USB2</CITE>, which unfortunately is very close to the similar sounding
<CITE>Hauppauge <A
HREF="http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/products/data_usb2.html">WinTV
USB2</A></CITE> (note the lack of &quot;PVR&quot; in the name) which is in fact a <em>completely</em> different and
less capable device from Hauppauge.  The pvrusb2 driver will therefore
never work with a <CITE>WinTV USB2</CITE>.  (See <A
HREF="http://mcentral.de/wiki/index.php/Em2880">here</A> for a driver
that should work with the WinTV USB2 hardware.)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There are two major variants of the PVR USB2 hardware in
circulation.  They can be physically distinguished by the white
sticker on the underside of the device - the retail boxes are
<em>identical</em>, unfortunately.  You can also distiguish the two
variants through the USB ID reported to the host when the device is
plugged in.

<UL>

<LI>The older device variant has a model number on that white sticker
which matches the pattern &quot;29xxx&quot;, and its reported USB ID
will be <tt>2040:2900</tt>.  Throughout this documentation, the older
device variant will be referred to as &quot;29xxx hardware&quot;.</LI>

<LI>The newer device variant has a model number on that white sticker
which matches the pattern &quot;24xxx&quot;, and its reported USB ID
will be <tt>2040:2400</tt>.  Throughout this documentation, the newer
device variant will be referred to as &quot;24xxx hardware&quot;.
(Actually there are several sub-variants of this device, but they all
identify with the same USB ID and the driver can treat them as the
same type of device.  The principle differences here involve IR
support which may impact things outside the driver but the driver
itself is mostly oblivious to such differences.)</LI>

</UL>

<P>This driver is intended to work with all hardware versions.  The
driver is equally stable in all cases.  See the <A
HREF="#Bugs">Bugs</A> section for more details.  Also, the firmware
situation and chip-level modules are different in the two cases, which
may impact how you set things up.  The documentation on this site
covers all model variants.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Over time I've been collecting a census of the various
Hauppauge model variants in circulation.  You can find the current
results in <A HREF="models.txt">models.txt</A>; please e-mail me if
you would like to add your device to the tally.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Hauppauge WinTV HVR-1950 / HVR-1900</H4>

<P>The <CITE>Hauppauge <A
HREF="http://www.hauppauge.com/site/products/data_hvr1950.html"> WinTV
HVR-1950</A></CITE> is a hybrid tuner and the successor to the older
PVR USB2.  It has all of the features of the PVR USB2 (analog TV and
FM tuners, hardware mpeg2 encoder, composite / s-video capture
inputs).  Plus it can tune ATSC digital broadcasts as well as analog.
It is also physically smaller than the PVR USB2.  This item can be
found at <A
HREF="http://www.pricegrabber.com/search_getprod.php/masterid=75631948">pricegrabber</A>.</P>

<P>The <CITE>Hauppauge <A
HREF="http://www.hauppauge.co.uk/site/products/data_hvr1900.html">WinTV
HVR-1900</A></CITE> is a similar device but is intended for DVB-T
reception instead of ATSC (thus it is marketed in the UK and not in
the USA).</P>

<P>The pvrusb2 driver fully supports these devices (analog and
digital) however FM radio support isn't there yet, owing to some
subtle hardware issues.  The analog side operates exactly the same as
the common predecessor PVR USB2.  The pvrusb2 driver's DVB interface
is used to access the digital side.</P>

<P>The HVR-1950 and HVR-1900 &quot;look&quot; the same to the pvrusb2
driver; thus anywhere I refer to one, the other always applies.
Warnings / caveats about the HVR-1950 in particular likely also apply
to the HVR-1900.  Throughout the rest of this documentation these will
be referred to as &quot;HVR-1950&quot; hardware.</P>

<H4>OnAir Sasem / OnAir Creator</H4>

<P>The <CITE>OnAir <A
HREF="http://www.autumnwave.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=104&Itemid=241">Sasem</A></CITE>
and <CITE>OnAir <A
HREF="http://www.autumnwave.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=103&Itemid=241">Creator</A></CITE>
devices are hybrid tuners.  There is no FM radio.  The digital side is
handled via DVB and the analog side through the usual means in the
pvrusb2 driver.  Their operation is identical from the application
point of view (minor internal differences, handled by the pvrusb2
driver).  They are fully supported by the pvrusb2 driver.</P>

<P>Throughout the rest of this documentation these will be referred to
as &quot;OnAir&quot; hardware.</P>

<H4>GOTVIEW USB 2.0 DVD2 / GOTVIEW USB 2.0 Deluxe</H4>

<P>The GOTVIEW <A
HREF="http://www.ixbt.com/monitor/gotv-usb-dvd2.html"><CITE>USB 2.0
DVD2</CITE></A> and <CITE>USB 2.0 DVD Deluxe</CITE> are tuners from a
Russian(?) vendor.  I don't speak / read Russian, but thanks to
another user of both of these devices I've implemented some minor
changes that allow this device to work.  I've had a few pings from
people asking if the pvrusb2 driver could be made to work with this
device, and after some trial &amp; error, it is working (including the
FM radio for the &quot;DVD 2&quot; - the &quot;DVD Deluxe&quot; does
not have an FM radio).</P>

<P>Where it matters, this documentation will refer to the
&quot;GOTVIEW USB2.0 DVD2&quot; and &quot;GOTVIEW USB2.0 DVD
Deluxe&quot; as simply &quot;Gotview&quot; hardware</P>

<H3>History</H3>

<P>This driver is very much a work in progress. Its history started
with the reverse-engineering effort by Bj&ouml;rn Danielsson whose web
page can be found <A HREF="http://pvrusb2.dax.nu/">here</A>. From
there Aurelien Alleaume began an effort to create a video4linux
compatible driver for the original PVR-USB2 29xxx series device. His
web page about this driver can be found <A
HREF="http://justiceforall.free.fr/pvrusb2.html">here</A>.  However
after October 2004, work there seemed to have stopped and repeated
attempts to contact him over several months since then were not
successful.  The driver hosted here picks up from that point.  I have
been maintaining / improving this since February 2005.</P>

<H3>Driver software versions: standalone vs in-V4L vs in-kernel</H3>

<P>There are three variations of this driver available.  One is here
on this site.  Another is hosted within the official <A
HREF="http://linuxtv.org">video4linux</A> Mercurial <A
HREF="http://linuxtv.org/hg/v4l-dvb">source tree</A>, and the third
variation is available in the Linux kernel tree, as of version 2.6.18.
I maintain them all and they are closely related.  You can use any;
the &quot;master&quot; version is currently the standalone version on
this site; the others are derived from here.  As for deciding which
you might want to try: The version in the kernel is of course
considered to be the most stable, so if you are using 2.6.18 or later
(and your hardware is supported by that particular vintage of kernel)
then just stick with that.  The version in V4L is more bleeding edge
than the kernel and what's in V4L today is expected to always be what
gets into the next kernel release.  If you want a more recent version
of the driver and if you are already into building &amp; running all
of V4L then the V4L version is probably what you want.  If on the
other hand you want the absolute latest version available and just
want to get this one driver working (damnit!) and don't want to learn
about Mercurial (V4L's source code manager), and you don't like the
idea of pulling in 50+ modules just to run one piece of hardware, then
you may prefer to run the standalone version hosted here.  It's up to
you.  Right now the way I do development is that the standalone
version is the &quot;primary&quot; version.  All others derive from
this version.  To update the V4L version I process the sources through
a Perl script that reconfigures the driver for use inside of V4L
(strips out source files and code that don't make sense there, and
enables some bits for in-V4L-tree operation that might otherwise be
shut off).  The kernel version is processed out of V4L.  I'm using
Subversion to maintain the driver sources and do diff / patching as
needed for any changes from that come back my way, regardless of
variation.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Note: Even if you choose to run the in-kernel version or
V4L hosted version of this driver, you will <strong>still</strong>
need to obtain (extract or otherwise fetch) and install the firmware.
There is an extraction script but it is not part of the V4L repository
or the kernel tree.  If you need just the extraction script (something
normally contained in the standalone driver snapshot), you can
download a reasonably recent version from here: <A
HREF="http://www.isely.net/downloads/fwextract.pl">http://www.isely.net/downloads/fwextract.pl</A>.
However, please see <A href="setup.html#Firmware_Obtaining">here</A>
for additional important information regarding how to obtain the
firmware.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="Setup">Setup</A></H2>

<P>To operate your pvrusb2-driven device in Linux, there are several
prerequisites and a number of things you must do first.</P>

<P>You must satisfy at least these prerequisites before the driver
will work:</P>

<UL>

<LI>You absolutely need a 2.6.x series kernel.  And the more recent,
the better.  In particular, handling the digital side of hybrid
devices works best using the 2.6.26 kernel or later.</LI>

<LI>Your system needs to be configured for udev support (or hotplug
for older distributions) for loading firmware - however any modern
Linux distribution within the past 4 years or so should already
satisfy this.</LI>

<LI>Your kernel needs to be configured with video4linux support,
including enough individual modules to support operation of the device
(exact modules depend on the device).  In addition - if you are using
a device which is also accessed through DVB (e.g. HVR-1950 or OnAir),
then your kernel needs to be configured with DVB support.</LI>

</UL>

<P>The <A HREF="setup.html#Prerequisites">Prerequisites /
Compatibility</A> section of <A HREF="setup.html">setup.html</A> has
the details for the above.</P>

<P>There are 3 basic steps you must complete in order to operate your
PVR USB2 device in Linux:</P>

<UL>

<LI>You must (of course) compile and install the pvrusb2 driver
itself.</LI>

<LI>You must obtain and install the required firmware images.</LI>

<LI>You <em>might</em> have to compile and install some support
modules (generally never needed - only an issue with much older
kernel versions).</LI>

</UL>

<P>If you are trying the in-V4L or in-kernel driver version, then the
compilation steps above are a part of the surrounding build and so you
don't have to do anything special there.  However even in that case
you still have to deal with the firmware part of the puzzle.</P>

<P>The following sections of <A HREF="setup.html">setup.html</A> have
the details for getting your PVR USB2 device working:</P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Usage">Usage</A></H2>

<P>The page <A HREF="usage.html">usage.html</A> has everything you
ever wanted to know about using this driver, but contained below is a
basic summary to get you going.</P>

<P>Plug in your tuner device and after a few seconds the driver should
be ready to go. Progress can be monitored through the kernel log.</P>

<P>Provided that you have udev installed on your system (a fairly safe
assumption these days), then within a few seconds after the driver
initializes, you should see something like this appear in your system:
<tt>/dev/video0</tt> (if this is the only video device in your
system).  If you're not running udev, then you need to make sure that
appropriate <tt>/dev</tt> entries have been configured into your
system; details for that (e.g. correct major / minor numbers) are a
V4L specific issue and outside the scope of documentation.  Really,
save yourself a headache and just use udev...</P>

<P>Once you have a valid <tt>/dev</tt> entry, then you can start
playing!  Any V4L application which can handle mpeg stream data should
be able to work.  You can also just &quot;cat&quot;
<tt>/dev/video0</tt> and you'll get a stream for whatever the device is
currently configured to capture (television, radio, composite, or
s-video).</P>

<P>In addition to the V4L API, there is limited support for DVB - for
handling the digital side of hybrid devices (e.g. HVR-1950,
OnAir).</P>

<P>This driver also implements a
sysfs-hosted interface, which can be found in
<tt>/sys/class/pvrusb2/sn-<em>xxxxxx</em></tt> or
<tt>/sys/class/pvrusb2/unit-<em>c</em></tt> (depending on whether the
hardware type reports a serial number or not).  Through that interface
you can operate the device right from your shell prompt without need
for any kind of utility program(s).  The driver snapshot even includes
some contributed shell scripts that do exactly this.</P>

<P>For <em>significantly</em> more information how to use this device,
please don't forget to examine <A
HREF="usage.html">usage.html</A>.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="FAQ">FAQ</A></H2>

<P>I've written up a short (but unfortunately now very old) list of
common mis-steps and solutions encountered by people trying the
driver.  If you have any suggestions for things to add here, please
let me know.  Hopefully you can find your situation described <A
HREF="faq.html">here</A>.  </P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Utilities">Utilities and Misc</A></H2>

<P>The driver package includes a few utilities and miscellaneous info
related to operation of this device.  This topic can be found in <A
HREF="utils.html">utils.html</A>.</P>

<P>The driver itself also implements an optional debug interface.  It
must be compiled into the driver.  Information about the debug
interface can be found in <A HREF="dbgifc.html">dbgifc.html</A>.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Bugs">Bugs</A></H2>

<P>Stability appears to be pretty decent overall.  Well except for
what's below...  Current known problems:</P>

<UL>

<LI>

<P>For all hardware device types, there are certain values for
horizontal resolution which produce distorted video.  This might be a
hardware limitation, so I might &quot;solve&quot; this by just causing
the driver to round-away from the bad values.  Currently this formula
can be used to predict if a given horizontal resolution is
watchable:</P>

<blockquote>watchable = ((hres - 1) >> 1) & 1) != 0</blockquote>

<P>For a given choice of &quot;hres&quot;, if &quot;watchable&quot; is
true then it should work.</P>

</LI>

<LI><P>For all hardware device types, there is a problem with
distortion in the audio when the volume is set too high.  The pvrusb2
driver starts with the volume set to the max, so you get the
distortion.  A while back (I think kernel 2.6.15 and previous), the
msp3400 chip-level driver scaled back the requested audio gain so that
&quot;maximum&quot; worked out to be a reasonable maximum for the part
(apparently).  Versions of msp3400 after that point eliminated the
scaling, so now &quot;maximum&quot; is simply mapped by that
chip-level driver to be the largest value possible that can be
programmed into the chip.  The pvrusb2 driver currently doesn't
attempt to scale this value - it just passes the value through,
untouched, to whatever chip-level driver is interested - so now the
result is clipping when the volume is at the max.</P>

<P>Though the msp3400 chip is specific to the 29xxx model series, the
same problem appears with the cx25840 chip in the 24xxx model series
and Gotview hardware as well.  The workaround is easy: lower the
volume.  Empirical testing here (on both types of devices) suggests
that right now 58000 is a good value for maximum gain distortion free
audio.</P>

<P>Probably the right thing to do here is to have the pvrusb2 driver
attempt to scale the volume as appropriate for the model / hardware
since it's really only at that place where we know what's
&quot;right&quot; for the entire combination of hardware that defines
the device as a whole.  This has been on my to-do list for a while,
but it just hasn't been a priority for me since the workaround is
fairly trivial (e.g. just reduce the volume).</P>

<P>Note: the default volume level is set now at a point where there
isn't any distortion.</P></LI>

<LI><P>There is a problem on older 29xxx hardware (saa7115 + msp3400
chips) with the audio when switching away from the FM radio - the
audio drops out.  This definitely happens when switching to television
mode.  Changing frequencies after that point seems to clear it.  The
problem appears related to recent changes that implement V4L
sub-device support.</P></LI>

</UL>

<P>Current missing features:</P>

<UL>

<LI><P>No FM support on HVR-1950 (still, as of March 2009).  Solving
this requires some enhancements to the cx25840 chip-level driver and
possibly also the pvrusb2 driver.  Not a showstopper, but this will
take some additional time.</P></LI>

<LI><P>No VBI support.  This is a much harder problem.  In fact I find
it amusing that apparently the Windows driver doesn't support VBI
either.  However after a short conversation with the current ivtv
maintainer, I understand now how they made it work in ivtv and I
believe a similar implementation should be possible here.  Update:
With the extinction of NTSC OTA television here in the USA, it is
highly unlikely that I will ever implement this ability.  For one
thing, I will now have an extremely hard time testing it.</P></LI>

<LI><P>No raw video support. i.e. uncompressed video frame data that
one would see from a capture card that does not have an mpeg encoder.
The pvrusb2 driver was never written with raw video in mind - and
until recently it was thought not to even be feasible.  However a
workable solution is understood now and I will see about implementing
it - but it will be a large driver change.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Limited DVB support.  If you are using a hybrid tuner, then a
DVB interface is available for the digital side of the tuner, but
that's it.  A long term goal is to have the V4L and DVB sides on equal
footing.</P></LI>

<LI><P>No support for any v4l I/O methods <em>except</em> for standard
<tt>read()</tt> style streaming.  This is not such a big problem that
one might think - the other two v4l I/O methods are really intended
for fast transfer of very large amounts of video data with hard record
boundaries.  What we have here however is a simple byte stream with
significantly lighter bandwidth demands (after all, this is compressed
mpeg2 video data we're talking about).  The v4l spec discourages use
of <tt>read()</tt> since there's no way to frame such data - but in
our case there is no framing needed anyway so it isn't a real issue.
However, for completeness - and once raw video support appears - the
other two methods need to be implemented.  The driver as it exists now
has an abstraction layer on top of which this may be done; it just
hasn't been done yet.</P></LI>
