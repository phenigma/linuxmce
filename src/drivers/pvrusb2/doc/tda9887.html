<P>This page describes issues involving the pvrusb2 driver's use of
the tda9887 module that is a part of Vidoe4Linux.  What is described
here is general information about the chip and its module, some tips
on making it work for the pvrusb2 driver, and a short history of
driver changes related to this module.  If you are having problems
related to bad tuning or no sound - or if you suspect TDA9887 problems
- reading this page might help.</P>

<P>Note that for pvrusb2 driver snapshots from 20051231 onward, this
should all be automatic now.  So hopefully if I got everything right
then you can ignore the rest of this page.  On the other hand...</P>

<P>You can find the main pvrusb2 driver page on the web at <A

<H2>General tda9887 information</H2>

<P>The TDA9887 is an I2C-accessed chip that is involved in
demodulation of the TV signal.  To do this job, it needs to be given
some configuration information relating to the video standard in use,
the mode (radio vs TV), the surrounding circuitry, and maybe also
related to the frequency being tuned (not sure about that last part).
This job is handled within V4L by the <tt>tda9887.ko</tt> module
(we'll just call it &quot;tda9887&quot; from here onward).</P>

<P>Like any I2C module in V4L, the tda9887 module when loaded will
scan a device's I2C bus for a TDA9887 chip, and upon finding one it
will attach to the bus and receive commands which it will interpret
into configuration changes for the chip.</P>

<P>One complication involved in the configuration of the TDA9887 is
that it has several binary configuration bits - &quot;port1&quot;,
&quot;port2&quot;, and &quot;qss&quot; - whose settings depend
apparently on the type of tuner being used and the surrounding
circuitry on the device.  This information unfortunately cannot be
easily learned just by monitoring the parent driver (i.e. pvrusb2) for
state changes, nor can the parent driver always know how these
settings should be controlled.  To get around this problem, the
tda9887 module has three module options that may be manually specified
when the module is loaded.  They are:</P>

<blockquote><code>
port1=&lt;x&gt;<br>
port2=&lt;x&gt;<br>
qss=&lt;x&gt;<br>
</code></blockquote>

<P>In each case <tt>&lt;x&gt;</tt> must be either 0 or 1.  I don't
entirely understand what these all are supposed to do, however they
all default to 1 if not otherwise controlled and I am told that
<tt>port1</tt> and <tt>port2</tt> at least must be set to 0 in order
to get sound when using PAL.  (In other cases it apparently doesn't do
any harm to have them be zero and without these set you may still at
least have tuning problems.)</P>

<P>A side note...  One other handy module option for tda9887 is
<TT>debug</TT>.  If you set <TT>debug=2</TT> as an option for tda9887,
i.e. if you do this:</P>

<blockquote><code>modprobe -r tda9887; modprobe tda9887
debug=2</code></blockquote>

<P>Then the tda9887 module will dump a verbose interpretation of the
commands it is sending to the chip, every time it configures the chip.
You'll be able to tell from that what the port1 and port2 settings
currently are.</P>

<P>The take-away here is that if you encounter a situation where sound
does not work, or tuning in general seems flakey, you may want to try
adjusting these settings.  This situation exists for any device which
has a TDA9887 inside of it; this is not specific to the pvrusb2
driver.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, with the pvrusb2 driver, the situation gets yet more
interesting...</P>

<H2>pvrusb2 and TDA9887</H2>

<P>There are two complications involving the pvrusb2 driver.  One is
that some PVR USB2 devices don't actually need the tda9887 module to
operate.  The other is that the pvrusb2 driver has had in it all along
some old hacked up code which had been trying to manipulate the
TDA9887 anyway.  These two complications just serve to further muddy
up any understanding of TDA9887 issues within this driver.</P>

<P>The first complication has to do with even having a TDA9887 present
at all.  It turns out that the PVR USB2 device I had been testing
against for the better part of a year doesn't need this help at all.
I <em>think</em> there may still be a TDA9887 inside of it, but I am
in NTSC territory here and my reading of the TDA9887 datasheet
suggests that it is possible to hardwire the TDA9887's configuration
for NTSC (thus no need for it to even be connected to the I2C bus).
So, there are PVR USB2 devices out there for which this TDA9887
nonsense is just, well, a non-issue.  Unfortunately that fact was true
for your driver author here and therefore I never even knew to suspect
issues here.  That all changed when I acquired a second PVR USB2
device, which <em>does</em> have a live TDA9887 in it.</P>

<P>The second complication has to do with some old logic in the
driver.  As I had stated at the top of the main driver web page, I
didn't write this driver.  The original version of this driver
directly coded for all those I2C chips within the driver itself and
did not depend on any outside I2C modules to assist in its operation.
All that hardwired code unfortunately wasn't very flexible and
couldn't account for all the various situations that people can find
themselves in while using the device.  One of the first things I did
therefore was to rip out all that old redundant code in favor of using
the already-debugged I2C modules in V4L.  During my initial work, I
did this for everything I could identify, and that resulted in the
pvrusb2 driver using tuner, saa7115, tveeprom, and msp3400.  However
at the time there was one block of wierd I2C commands that I could not
identify.  At the time - not wishing to mess with what apparently
wasn't harming anything - I decided to just leave that logic intact.
It turns out that this unidentified logic was in fact the hardwired
stand-in for the tda9887 module.  Upon finally understanding this I
recently ripped out that old code from the pvrusb2 driver so that
tda9887 could do its job properly.</P>

<P><strong>What the above means is that people who didn't think they
needed tda9887 nearby may now suddenly find that they need
it.</strong></P>

<P>The pvrusb2 driver as it stands for the 20051231 snapshot and
onward should have everything correct now.  With that snapshot, all
the old hack code is gone, and the driver attempts to correctly
operate the tda9887 module.  But for clarity, here is a summary of the
snapshots over time and how each interacted with the TDA9887 chip:</P>


<H3>Before 20051206</H3>

<P>For everything before the 20051206 snapshot, the pvrusb2 driver
made no attempt to interact with the tda9887 module and that old
TDA9887-controlling hack code was present.</P>

<H3>20051206 to 20051208</H3>

<P>In late November 2005, I began learning the wonders of TDA9887
(said with tongue in cheek), and thus with the 20051206 snapshot, the
pvrusb2 driver now recognized the tda9887 module and attempted to
operate it.  But this was very minimal - I still had yet to learn
about the port1 / port2 nonsense and I hadn't yet stumbled back on
that old hacked up TDA9887-controlling code that was still lurking in
the driver.  So what worked here at all probably worked badly.</P>

<H3>20051226</H3>

<P>Unfortunately in parallel to the TDA9887 craziness I was also in
the middle of a large round of driver changes that involved how the
driver interacts with all of the I2C modules.  But in the middle of
all that I ran into the old hacked TDA9887 code and suddenly realized
that it was probably clashing with the tda9887 module.  The purpose of
this snapshot was to remove that hacked code.  At this point there was
still no attempt in the pvrusb2 driver to deal with the port1 / port2
configuration issues.  Anyone using this snapshot therefore still has
to possibly specify &quot;port1=0 port2=0&quot; as options to the
tda9887 module.  The exact workaround for this snapshot should be
this:</P>

<OL>
<LI><TT>modprobe -r tda9887</TT></LI>
<LI><TT>modprobe tda9887 port1=0 port2=0</TT></LI>
<LI>Unplug, then plug the PVR USB2 device back in.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The last step is needed because this driver snapshot did not know
to reconfigure the tda9887 module when it reappears in the system.
Re-plugging the hardware forces the entire driver to re-initialize
itself and thus tda9887 along with it.  (The big change in the next
snapshot solves that issue.)</P>

<H3>20051231 to present</H3>

<P>From the New Years Eve snapshot onward, the pvrusb2 driver includes
new logic to handle all the I2C modules.  With this change comes a new
ability implemented for tda9887.  Now when the pvrusb2 driver detects
tuner types 38 or 43, AND if tda9887 is attached, it will issue a
command to the tda9887 module to set port1=0 and port2=0.  The new I2C
control logic is also smart enough to autonomously (re)do this change
when circumstances change, e.g. if the tda9887 module is unloaded then
reloaded.</P>

<P>At this point, everything should be correct.</P>

<P>The decision to only set port1=0 and port2=0 on tuner types 38 and
43 follows behavior in the ivtv driver (well, for type 38, where this
seems to work).  I have no idea if this is good enough however.  It's
possible that other tuner types with tda9887 loaded may require this
tweak.  In any case however the settings for port1, port2 (and qss)
can still always be overridden using the usual tda9887 module
options.</P>
