<H2><A NAME="Overview">Overview</A></H2>

<P>Hardware driven by the pvrusb2 driver has several parts within it
that require firmware images to be loaded first in order to operate
correctly.  That firmware is not a part of this driver; you must
obtain it from elsewhere (e.g. your Windows driver CD, the device
maker's web site, or perhaps a 3rd party).  In addition, the exact
firmware files you will need will depend on which device you have.
Whether you are using the standalone pvrusb2 driver snapshot or the
in-V4L version of the pvrusb2 driver, you will need to obtain and
install the appropriate firmware images before your device will
function correctly.</P>

<P>The easiest means for obtaining or extracting the firmware is
<em>NOT</em> described here.  It is instead documented as part of the
normal driver setup.  You can find that information in the <A
HREF="setup.html#Firmware">Firmware retrieval and installation</A>
section within <A HREF="setup.html">setup.html</A>.  Try there first,
and if that failed to work, then read on.</P>

<P>There is the occasional situation where the easy method doesn't
work.  It is possible that <tt>fwextract.pl</tt> might not recognize
your driver package (you did uncompress it first, right?) no matter
what you throw at it; you'll see messages of the form &quot;failed to
locate data for writing filename&quot; (where filename is the firmware
file it tried to generate).  This can happen if the device vendor
releases new drivers and <tt>fwextract.pl</tt> hasn't been updated
yet.  If this is indeed the case, then things are somewhat more
difficult - we need to manually identify the firmware data and teach
the script where to find it when it encounters the new driver
package.</P>

<P>Basically what has to be done if this happens is something like
this:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Find some alternate means to get the firmware data.</LI>

<LI>Run &quot;fwextract.pl --search&quot;.</LI>

</OL>

<P>The second step runs a process to scan the original Windows driver
files and find where the firmware (previously fetched here in step 1)
is hiding.  Once found, <tt>fwextract.pl</tt> will write a Perl
expression to the terminal which contains new table entry needed by
the extractor for locating the firmware in the future.  Send that
snippet to me and I'll place it into the master copy of
<tt>fwextract.pl</tt> so that other users can benefit from your
hacking effort.</P>

<P>The first step here is obviously the big one.  There are two
approaches to it.  One approach is that someone good at
reverse-engineering starts hacking away with a hex editor to find the
embedded data.  Yuck.  Another approach is to capture the firmware
from the hardware itself - which we can do.  There are typically two
pieces of data to capture: the cx23416 (mpeg encoder) firmware and the
FX2 (device microcontroller) firmware.  If you have 24xxx, Gotview, or
HVR-1950 hardware, then you also need to capture the cx25840 (video &
audio digitizer) firmware as well.  Note: The Gotview and OnAir
devices store the FX2's program in a local ROM so there's no need to
worry about FX2 firmware in those cases.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Encoder">cx23416 &amp; cx25840 firmware capture</A></H2>

<P>To manually capture the cx23416 and cx25840 firmware images, you
need to use the USB sniffer to grab it &quot;in flight&quot; from
within Windows and then use several tools included with the standalone
driver snapshot to extract the firmware data from the stream.</P>

<P>The USB sniffer is a handy free utility that can be found at
<AHREF="http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop/">http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop/</A>.
Make sure you grab the latest version of the sniffer - the download
list on the site shows version oldest to newest, so be sure to scroll
to the bottom of the list.  The sniffer version I've used is 1.8.</P>

<P>The additional tools you will need are included with the standalone
driver snapshot.  Specifically, you will need <tt>usbreplay.pl</tt> to
distill the output of the USB sniffer down to a simpler form, and you
will need the decompiler (<tt>decode_log</tt> with the
&quot;--firmware&quot; option) to extract the firmware data from the
stream.  Note that the decompiler is C++; if you haven't yet compiled
it then just run <tt>make</tt> in the <tt>utils</tt> directory to
build it.</P>

<P>Additional information about all of this can be found in the <A
HREF="utils.html#sniff">Sniffing and decompiling USB traffic</A>
section of of the <A HREF="utils.html">utils.html</A> page.</P>

<P>The process is roughly the same regardless of the type of hardware
you have - you'll get one file out of this if you are using 29xxx
hardware and two files if you are using 24xxx or Gotview hardware.
Here's the exact procedure:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Boot up Windows and start the USB sniffer.  Plug in the pvrusb2
device.  You don't need to run anything but just wait for the sniffer
to collect the log data from when the driver initializes the
device.</LI>

<LI>Copy the sniffer's log data to some place where you can get at it
from Linux.</LI>

<LI>Boot Linux.</LI>

<LI>Run this sequence (substitute "<tt>usbsnoop.log</tt>" with the file
you got from the sniffer):</LI>

<PRE><CODE>usbreplayprep.pl < usbsnoop.log | decode_log --firmware firmware_file > /dev/null</CODE></PRE>

</OL>

<P>The result of that last step will be either 1 or 2 files.  If you
are using 29xxx hardware you should see one file named
&quot;<tt>firmware_file</tt>&quot;.  Otherwise you should see two
files, named &quot;<tt>firmware_file-1</tt>&quot; and
&quot;<tt>firmware_file-2</tt>&quot;.  You need to rename these files.
For 29xxx hardware with a single file, just do this:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>mv firmware_file v4l-cx2341x-enc.fw</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>For 24xxx or Gotview hardware, you first need to figure out which
file is which and then rename them accordingly.  You must
<strong>not</strong> get this backwards!  One file will be
approximately 256KB (or slightly larger) in size - that will be the
cx23416 image and you should rename that to
&quot;<tt>v4l-cx2341x-enc.fw</tt>&quot;.  The other file will be
roughly 13KB in size (this might vary); rename that file to
&quot;<tt>v4l-cx25840.fw</tt>&quot;.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="FX2">FX2 firmware capture</A></H2>

<P>If you are using a Gotview or OnAir device, the FX2 program is held
in the device in ROM, so there's no FX2 firmware to extract and you
can safely skip this entire part of the procedure.</P>

<blockquote><strong>Important note:</strong> If you are using the
in-V4L or in-kernel versions of the pvrusb2 driver, be sure you have
built it with the debug interface option
(CONFIG_VIDEO_PVRUSB2_DEBUGIFC) enabled.  Doing this enables a feature
that you need in order to capture the FX2 firmware.  Frequently
distro-supplied precompiled kernels will <em>not</em> have this option
set!  For the standalone pvrusb2 driver, this is enabled by default.
If you are using a distro-supplied kernel and it appears that the
debug interface is not enabled, it is probably easier to just grab and
build the standalone driver rather than trying to recompile a piece of
the distro's kernel package...</blockquote>

<P>Capturing of the FX2 firmware is entirely different.  The USB
sniffer doesn't see this traffic right now so we have to take a
different strategy.  I've added a feature to the pvrusb2 driver that
makes possible the direct retrieval of the firmware data from the
device.  Here's the procedure:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Boot up Windows, power cycle the device, and then plug in the
pvrusb2 device.</LI>

<LI>Reboot to Linux <strong>LEAVING THE PVRUSB2 DEVICE POWERED
UP</strong>.</LI>

<LI>Execute this sequence (substitute your device's serial number for
"<tt>XXXXXXX</tt>" and change "<tt>/dev/video0</tt>" to match the
<tt>/dev</tt> name corresponding to your device):<BR>

<PRE><CODE>echo "cpufw fetch" >/sys/class/pvrusb2/sn-XXXXXXX/debugcmd
cat /dev/video0 >/tmp/fx2.fw
echo "cpufw done" >/sys/class/pvrusb2/sn-XXXXXXX/debugcmd</CODE></PRE></LI>

<LI>Rename the firmware file to correspond to your hardware type.  For
29xxx hardware, rename <tt>fx2.fw</tt> to
<tt>v4l-pvrusb2-29xxx-01.fw</tt>.  For 24xxx hardware, rename
<tt>fx2.fw</tt> to <tt>v4l-pvrusb2-24xxx-01.fw</tt>.  For HVR-1950
hardware, rename <tt>fx2.fw</tt> to <tt>v4l-pvrusb2-73xxx-01.fw</tt>.
This differentiation of firmware name is <strong>extremely</strong>
important because the FX2 firmware is actually different and
incompatible among all device versions.</LI>

</OL>

<P><em>Very</em> important exception to the above procedure: If you
are doing this on an HVR-1950 device, then it is likely that the
firmware image will be 16KB (16384) instead of 8KB (8192).  The above
procedure only grabs the first 8KB and this will ultimately result in
corrupted firmware (it won't be subtle when you later test it).  To
deal with this, modify the first echo command to be this instead:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>echo "cpufw fetch ram16k" >/sys/class/pvrusb2/sn-XXXXXXX/debugcmd</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>That tells the pvrusb2 driver to grab 16KB instead of 8KB.  (Yes I
can make this work smarter but that still needs more work.)</P>

<P>It is imperative that you do not power cycle the device when
switching from Windows to Linux.  This allows the FX2 firmware to be
retained in the device's memory, and will cause the pvrusb2 Linux
driver to not attempt to reload the firmware.  Thus when you run the
command sequence to pull the firmware back, you'll get what had
previously been loaded by Windows.</P>

<P>Your device will reset itself after the "cpufw done" debug command
is sent to the driver.  The file <tt>/tmp/v4l-pvrusb2-29xxx-01.fw</tt>
for 29xxx hardware (or <tt>/tmp/v4l-pvrusb2-24xxx-01.fw</tt> for 24xxx
hardware) is an image of the FX2's program memory.  Note that this
isn't the <em>exact</em> bit-for-bit copy of the firmware file you
need; apparently the FX2 program modifies itself slightly.  However
it's close enough that the fwextract.pl program's --search feature can
still locate the pristine firmware data using a fuzzy matching
algorithm (which it will fall back to if an exact search doesn't find
it).</P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Search">Locating the Firmware</A></H2>

<P>After you've gotten the firmware images retrieved and named
correctly, put copies of all the files in the current directory (if
you haven't already done so).  The exact set of files to have copied
will depend on your hardware type; just to review, by this point you
should have copied across the following names:</P>

<P>For 29xxx hardware:</P>
<blockquote><code>
v4l-cx2341x-enc.fw<BR>
v4l-pvrusb2-29xxx-01.fw<BR>
</code></blockquote>

<P>For 24xxx hardware:</P>
<blockquote><code>
v4l-cx2341x-enc.fw<BR>
v4l-pvrusb2-24xxx-01.fw<BR>
v4l-cx25840.fw<BR>
</code></blockquote>

<P>For Gotview hardware:</P>
<blockquote><code>
v4l-cx2341x-enc.fw<BR>
v4l-cx25840.fw<BR>
</code></blockquote>

<P>For OnAir hardware:</P>
<blockquote><code>
v4l-cx2341x-enc.fw<BR>
</code></blockquote>

<P>For HVR-1950 hardware:</P>
<blockquote><code>
v4l-cx2341x-enc.fw<BR>
v4l-pvrusb2-73xxx-01.fw<BR>
v4l-cx25840.fw<BR>
</code></blockquote>

<P>Now unpack the vendor's Windows driver package again into an empty
&quot;<tt>win_driver</tt>&quot; subdirectory, then run
<tt>fwextract.pl --search</tt>.  (If you installed from a cdrom, you
can alternatively mount the cdrom under Linux and use the
--driverDir=&lt;path&gt; option to point at the mount point instead of
the default <tt>win_driver</tt> subdirectory.)  After a minute or so
it will print the magic chunk of data that can then be put back inside
<tt>fwextract.pl</tt> so it will now automatically understand how to
extract this firmware data in the future.  Send that magic chunk to me
(along with a description of the driver package) and I'll ensure that
the next release of <tt>fwextract.pl</tt> includes it.</P>

<P>You should in theory be able to just use the manually extracted
firmware files.  However the FX2 firmware image (one of
<tt>v4l-pvrusb2-29xxx-01.fw</tt>, <tt>v4l-pvrusb2-24xxx-01.fw</tt>, or
<tt>v4l-pvrusb2-73xxx-01.fw</tt>) may not be exactly identical to what
is really loaded, so you may really want to go back and get the real
firmware out of the driver directory anyway.  Do the following:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Edit your copy of <tt>fwextract.pl</tt> and insert that previously
printed magic chunk of Perl data into it.  Read the comments in the
file; there is a data structure near the top of the file and you
should be able to recognize the pattern for how to insert the data.
(Note: Realize that you may have to append a trailing comma in order
to stay syntactically correct.)</LI>

<LI>Now go back and just run a normal extraction operation (e.g. that
which is documented in the <A HREF="setup.html#Firmware">Firmware
extraction and installation</A> section within <A
HREF="setup.html">setup.html</A>.</LI>

</OL>

<P>Don't forget to send me that magic chunk of data so that I can
update the master copy of <tt>fwextract.pl</tt>.  Please also include
a 1 line description that indicates some kind of uniquely identifiable
attribute of the driver package from where you extracted the firmware.
