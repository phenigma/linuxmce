<P>This page briefly describes the usage of the utilities included
with the pvrusb2 driver distribution.</P>

<P>You can find the main driver page on the web at <A
HREF="http://www.isely.net/pvrusb2/pvrusb2.html">http://www.isely.net/pvrusb2/pvrusb2.html</A>.</P>

<HR>
<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>The utilities can be found in the <tt>utils</tt> subdirectory.  They
include the following:</P>

<UL>

<LI><em><tt>94-local.rules</tt></em> - This is a udev configuration
fragment which can be used in conjunction with <tt>udev-pvrusb2</tt>
to automatically create predictable device access nodes in the file
system (see further).</LI>

<LI><em><tt>change-channel.sh</tt></em> - This is a bash program which
provides an interface for managing channel IDs and changing channels
through the driver's sysfs interface.  This script works with a
configuration file that associates channel IDs with frequencies; it
does not need or use the sysfs frequency table logic in the driver.
This was created and contributed by Per Christian Henden; for his
e-mail address and a description on how to use the script along with a
brief method to generate the frequency data from xawtv, please see the
comments at the top of the script.</LI>

<LI><em><tt>decode_eeprom.cpp</tt></em> - This is the source for a
utility that can parse out an FX2 load image from an eeprom image.
The FX2 loads code from a resident eeprom using packets in the eeprom.
This program can parse each packet and emit a set of s-records of the
contained data (which can then be fed to a disassembler).</LI>

<LI><em><tt>decode_log.cpp</tt></em> - This is a decompiler, which is
used to interpret the USB traffic flowing between the pvrusb2 device
and the driver.</LI>

<LI><em><tt>fwextract.pl</tt></em> - This is a Perl program which
handles extraction of firmware data out of Hauppauge's Windows driver
files.  See <A HREF="setup.html#Firmware">setup.html</A> and <A
HREF="firmware.html">firmware.html</A> for more information about this
program.</LI>

<LI><em><tt>fwfind.sh</tt></em> - This is a contributed bash program
which further automates firmware extraction.  This is discussed
briefly on the <A HREF="setup.html#Firmware">setup.html</A> page.</LI>

<LI><em><tt>old-extract-firmware.pl</tt></em> - This is the old
firmware extractor created by Bj&ouml;rn Danielsson.  Use the newer
<tt>fwextract.pl</tt> program instead; this is included here for
historical reasons and also as a last resort fallback in case problems
are encountered with the new extractor (but please contact me if you
find yourself having to use it).</LI>

<LI><em><tt>pvrui.sh</tt></em> - This is a contributed shell script that
uses the dialog utility to implement a nice interactive front end to
the driver's sysfs interface.  This script was written by Phil
Endecott; see the comments at the top of the script for his contact
information.  Note: This script is somewhat broken right now; it needs
to be updated to account for new types possible in sysfs and the fact
that enumeration values can have embedded spaces.</LI>

<LI><em><tt>udev-pvrusb2</tt></em> - This is a script fragment which
can be used in conjunction with <tt>94-local.rules</tt> to
automatically create predictable device access nodes in the file
system (see further).</LI>

<LI><em><tt>usbreplayprep.pl</tt></em> - This is a Perl script which
can postprocess USB sniffer output into a compact form that the
decompiler can parse.  This also originally came from Bj&ouml;rn
however it has been modified to also preserve data coming from the
device (older version only preserved data going *to* the device).</LI>

<H2><A NAME="sniff">Fun with udev and the pvrusb2 driver</A></H2>

<P>Thanks to an intrepid user, Roger Allen, who got sick of the
non-deterministic assignment of device nodes, we have a tool here that
can be used to configure udev to assign a predictable name to each
device instance.  The solution is contained in the two files here,
<tt>udev-pvrusb2</tt> and <tt>94-local.rules</tt>.  This is by no
means the <em>only</em> way to do it, but it is a good example.  One
could also probably use a variation to change the group and mode of
the sysfs interface files too...</P>

<P>Rather than explaining this in my words, here's the description in
Roger's words (note: I replaced the serial numbers with obvious fake
values):</P>

<blockquote> <p>After spending months checking dmesg to see which of
my two WinTV-PVR-USB2 devices would win the race for /dev/video0, I
finally got around to learning enough about udev rules to straighten
out my mess.  I have Comcast Chicago cable with a single settopbox
which is feeding the composite of one of the boxes, while the other
one is connected directly to the coax and tuning the few (31 and
decreasing) available unecrypted analog cable channels.  This is
working under Fedora 8 with mythtv rpms from atrpms.  I tried to keep
it simple so it only uses the shell and grep.  Fedora doesn't have a
"video" group, so this is using "mythtv" instead.  I modified the
mythbackend to run as "mythtv" instead of "root".  Other dists will
probably want to change the GROUP and/or OWNER or not use OWNER at all
in the udev rule.  The rule creates symlinks for /dev/comcasta and
/dev/comcastd for Analog and Digital.  There are comments in
udev-pvrusb2 describing how to use it with mythtv-setup.  I'm sure the
shell script could be better written, but it works for me.</p>

<p>This mythtv backend also has a Kworld ATSC-110 using /dev/video2,
which the script successfully leaves alone, so it should play nice
with other video devices.</p>

<p>The single line udev rule goes into
/etc/udev/rules.d/94-local.rules or whatever file your Linux
distribution likes: [copy of <tt>94-local.rules</tt>]</p>

<code><pre>

<p>The /usr/local/bin/udev-pvrusb2 script (don't forget to make it
executable) is: [copy of <tt>udev-pvrusb2</tt>]</p>

then
	echo $Symlink2
	exit 0
fi
exit 1
</pre></code>

<p>Unless you break into my home and steal my WinTV-PVR-USB2s, change
the serial numbers and symlink names to taste.  If you have more than
two devices, just modify the udev-pvrusb2 script.</p>

<p>You can mangle the bits any way you want.  If you find that it
needs tweaking for other Linux distributions, then please post your
fixes.</p>

<H2><A NAME="sniff">Sniffing and decompiling USB traffic</A></H2>

<P>There is a free USB sniffer that can be run under Windows for
capturing all traffic between a USB device and its driver.  The home
page for it is <A
HREF="http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop/">here</A>.  Using
this tool we can learn about how the Windows driver operates the
device.  If you want to explore, download that tool and follow the
related instructions.</P>

<P>To help with understanding the log data from the sniffer, there are
two tools provided with this driver:</P>

<blockquote>The first tool is <tt>usbreplayprep.pl</tt>, which will
preprocess the USB sniffer data into a more compact form.  This tool
was originally written by Bj&ouml;rn but I have since modified it to
provide more data.  The version provided here saves both directions of
traffic; the previous one only saved data going in the
driver-to-device direction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The second tool is <tt>decode_log</tt>, which is compiled
from the similarly named C++ source file.  This program interprets the
output from usbreplayprep.pl and produces a concise listing of all the
commands and data moving to / from the device and the driver.  (This
tool can also capture and save the encoder firmware if seen as part of
the log.)</blockquote>

<P>The decompiler is a 2-weekend hack that I wrote in C++ and must be
built first.  Run make in the utils directory to build this tool.
Note that this program has no other dependencies beyond needing C++ so
it should be a straight-forward build.</P>

<P>To capture and decompile a session with the device when run with
the Windows driver, do the following:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Boot windows, start the sniffer and enable it, and plug in the
device.</LI>

<LI>Run your TV app for a little while.  NOTE: The sniffer log data
can get ENORMOUS so you may not want to run it for long.  Also the
capture process does slow things down so the video playback in the TV
app might get choppy, but that's OK.</LI>

<LI>Copy the log data to your Linux system or reboot to Linux</LI>

<LI>Run <tt>usbreplayprep.pl < data.log >data.txt</tt> where
<tt>data.log</tt> is the name of the log output from the sniffer.</LI>

<LI>Run <tt>decode_log < data.txt > data.src</tt> and the decompiled
output will be in data.src.</LI>

</OL>

<P>The decompiler also has an option for saving off the encoder
firmware captured, which is useful when one has to figure out the
firmware extraction details for a newer Hauppauge driver snapshot.
There's lots more about that feature described in <A
HREF="firmware.html">firmware.html</A>.</P>
