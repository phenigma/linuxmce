HREF="http://www.isely.net/pvrusb2/pvrusb2.html">http://www.isely.net/pvrusb2/pvrusb2.html</A>.</P>

<P>This page provides additional information related to operation of
the driver's debug interface.  You don't need to worry about this
information unless you're actually trying to debug a problem.  (This
interface is also used for part of the manual firmware extraction
process however in that case, the instructions for that process
include the debug interface information you would need.)</P>

<H2><A NAME="Overview">Overview</A></H2>

<P>The pvrusb2 driver includes a debug interface, which is a method
for inspecting driver information and injecting actions into the
driver.  The interface is command line-based; i.e. you feed the driver
a string containing a command and read back results.</P>

<P>Given that we're talking about a Linux kernel mode driver and not
some kind of userspace application, then how is it possible to even
<em>have</em> a command interface?  It's just another sysfs trick.
Commands are issued by echoing the string into a particular sysfs
file.  Reading that same file back returns status information.  It's
that simple.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Basics">Debug Interface Basics</A></H2>

<P>First, you need to ensure that the debug interface has been
compiled into the driver.  Since this interface isn't needed for
normal driver operation, then it's likely that a distribution's
precompiled kernel with this driver might not have it on.  If that is
the case for you, then you'll have to rebuild the driver with the
appropriate CONFIG option set.  Sorry, but that's unavoidable.</P>

<P>The CONFIG option that needs to be on is
&quot;CONFIG_VIDEO_PVRUSB2_DEBUGIFC&quot;; it is described as
&quot;pvrusb2 debug interface&quot; as an option related to selecting
the pvrusb2 driver itself.</P>

<P>If you are using a standalone snapshot of the driver (i.e. you
downloaded a tarball from the pvrusb2 web site), then the build
process normally always turns on this option for you.  In that case,
you can ignore the previous two paragraphs.</P>

<P>To access the debug interface, plug in your device as usual, open a
shell prompt, then change directory to the driver's sysfs directory.
The directory you want will be of the pattern
&quot;<tt>/sys/class/pvrusb2/sn-XXXXXXXX</tt>&quot;.  (General
information about the sysfs interface can be found <A
HREF="usage.html#sysfs">here</A>.)  List that directory and you should
find two entries of interest, one named &quot;<tt>debugcmd</tt>&quot;
and the other named &quot;<tt>debuginfo</tt>&quot;.  If they aren't
present, then odds are that the debug interface has not been compiled
into the driver - see above for information on fixing that
problem.</P>

<P>The &quot;<tt>debugcmd</tt>&quot; file is how commands are issued;
anything written to here will be parsed and acted upon by the pvrusb2
driver.</LI>

<P>You can read from either of &quot;<tt>debugcmd</tt>&quot; or
&quot;<tt>debuginfo</tt>&quot; to retrieve debugging information from
the driver.  Different information is produced in each case.</P>

<P>Generally, reading from debugcmd returns information more directly
related to specific low level debugging and only really has meaning in
the context of other debug commands.  Information printed from
debugcmd will include a report of USB link speed, GPIO states, and an
indication if streaming should be in progress or not.</P>

<P>Reading from &quot;<tt>debuginfo</tt>&quot; produces information
about the driver as a whole - and the mere act of reading this file
also triggers a dump of more information into the system log.  You'll
get 3 categories of information here:</P>

<UL>

<LI>First, a complete dump of the driver's current control state will
be printed - these variables indicate how the driver currently has
configured various parts of the streaming pipeline.  This is used to
help in debugging the driver's pipeline control logic (which can be
somewhat complex).</LI>

<LI>Following the control state dump will be a list of currently
attached I2C modules, one line per module.  This can be used to
determine if a module is not attached / missing (e.g. perhaps tuner.ko
didn't get loaded into the kernel).<LI>

<LI>In addition to producing
this direct output, the act of reading from this file <em>also</em>
triggers an internal action that causes all attached I2C modules to
dump debug info into the system log.  The driver itself will also dump
additional info into the system log.</LI>

</UL>

<P>A lot can be learned about what is going on simply by reading
&quot;<tt>debuginfo</tt>&quot; and also examining the system log
afterwards.</P>

<P>To make this a little more clear, let's consider an example.
Suppose you wanted to force the FX2 processor to reset.  The command in
that case would be:</P>

<blockquote><code>echo &quot;reset cpu&quot; &gt;debugcmd</code></blockquote>

<P>That then causes the driver to issue USB control transfers that
ultimately force the FX2 to reset.  (However you probably don't want
to do this just for kicks, as it will cause the device to momentarily
disconnect its USB interface which will look to the kernel like you
unplugged then replugged in the cable, which will then cause this
sysfs instance to be reset as well.  But hey, I said this was a
<em>debug</em> interface...)</P>

<P>To summarize:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Write to &quot;<tt>debugcmd</tt>&quot; to issue a debug interface
command.</LI>

<LI>Read from &quot;<tt>debugcmd</tt>&quot; to retrieve debug
interface status.</LI>

<LI>Read from &quot;<tt>debuginfo</tt>&quot; to retrieve general
driver status information.</LI>

</UL>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Commands">Debug Interface Available Commands</A></H2>

<P>Below is a list of the currently available debug interface
commands.  Please remember that these commands <em>are</em> for
debugging issues and not for normal operation.  Many of these actions
can potentially leave the driver in an operable state and/or require
power cycling of the PVR USB2 hardware.</P>

<H3>Various Resets</H3>

<DL>

<DT><code>reset cpu</code></DT><DD>A CPU reset triggers a direct reset
of the FX2 microcontroller within the PVR USB2 device.  Doing this
<em>will</em> cause the PVR USB2 hardware to temporarily disconnect
itself from the USB controller; that will have the effect of causing
the entire sysfs interface to momentarily disappear then reinitialize
(same action as if you unplugged the hardware then plugged it back
in).</DD>

<DT><code>reset bus</code></DT><DD>A bus reset causes the USB-level
transaction that resets the bus itself.  This reset is specific to the
device at the other end of the bus, that being the PVR USB2 device.
It should not affect any other connected devices.</DD>

<DT><code>reset soft</code></DT><DD>A soft reset triggers a specific
FX2 command that is suspected to reset some internal state.  This
might not be entirely correct, but the command is here.</DD>

<DT><code>reset deep</code></DT><DD>A &quot;deep&quot; reset triggers
a specific FX2 command that is suspected to reset additional internal
PVR USB2 hardware.  Again, this might be entirely correct, but the
command remains mainly due to history.</DD>

<DT><code>reset firmware</code></DT><DD>To reset the
&quot;firmware&quot; in this case is actually an action to cause the
encoder's firmware to be reloaded.  Normally you never need to do this
because the driver itself figures out when the encoder needs a reload
and will do it on its own.</DD>

<DT><code>reset decoder</code></DT><DD>This issues a reset command to
the decoder chip (e.g. the cx25843 or the saa7115) inside the device.
Again this sort of action is normally handled automatically.</DD>

<DT><code>reset worker</code></DT><DD>The driver has a soft
&quot;error&quot; state it can get into under certain circumstances.
At the moment this can happen if it fails to load the encoder
firmware.  This error state is implemented in an attempt to keep the
driver from getting into a tight loop where it might be continuously
trying to fruitlessly reload the firmware.  Once the state it set, the
driver essentially gives up until the state is cleared.  Under normal
circumstances the driver will automatically clear this state if it
thinks there is a reason why it might now succeed where previously it
had failed.  But you can also manually clear the error state with this
command.</DD>

</DL>

<H3>Firmware Fetching</H3>

<P>The driver implements a mechanism for pulling firmware data back
out of the device.  This refers to only the FX2 firmware - currently
there isn't any known means for retrieving the encoder firmware after
it has been loaded.  This ability is used as part of the manual
firmware extraction process (relevant part described <A
HREF="firmware.html#FX2">here</A>).</P>

<P>The debug interface itself has no means for actually reading large
amounts of data (and sysfs itself really isn't that suitable for such
a thing).  Because of this, the actual act of slurping out the
firmware contents happens through the V4L interface.  But it is
controlled through the debug interface.  This works by first issuing a
debug interface command to put the driver into &quot;suck firmware
mode&quot;, then you can grab the contents with a normal cat command
from the <tt>/dev</tt> node (e.g. &quot;<tt>/dev/video0</tt>&quot;)
you would normally use to stream video.  Finally another debug
interface command is issued to return the driver back to normal
mode.  The debug interface commands are:</P>

<DL>

<DT><code>cpufw fetch ram</code></DT><DD>Put the driver into firmware
fetching mode and grab the in-memory contents of the FX2 microcontroller.</DD>

<DT><code>cpufw fetch prom</code></DT><DD>Put the driver into firmware
fetching mode and grab the contents of the device's I2C PROM.  This
may or may not make sense for the particular device.  Some devices
load their FX2 firmware from a nearby I2C PROM device; others expect
to be loaded by the host.  In the host-loaded cases the PROM might not
have anything useful (it might not even be present).</DD>

<DT><code>cpufw done</code></DT><DD>Undo the effects of either of the
cpufw fetch commands and return the driver to normal operation.</DD>

</DL>

<P>So, to use this mechanism one must do:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Issue either &quot;cpufw fetch ram&quot; or &quot;cpufw fetch
prom&quot; to the debug interface</LI>

<LI>Grab the firmware contents, by for example doing: <code>cat /dev/video &gt;tmp/foo.fw</code></LI>

<LI>Issue either &quot;cpufw done&quot; to the debug interface</LI>

</OL>

<P>Note that the hardware implementation that makes the &quot;cpufw
fetch ram&quot; command possible is somewhat destructive to the
device's current state.  No permanent harm is done of course, but when
the &quot;done&quot; step is performed, the device will reset itself
and the driver will re-initialize it.  That will also have the effect
of causing the driver's sysfs interface to be torn down and recreated
(thus affecting this debug interface).</P>

<H3>GPIO Manipulation</H3>

<P>The encoder chip has the ability to control a set of general
purpose I/O (GPIO) signals.  Various tuner devices use these signals
to affect aspects of the device.  For example, Hauppauge tuners use
one GPIO to control the LED.  Other devices might use a GPIO to switch
an analog mux that might control selection of the stereo audio input
versus the internal FM tuner.  Encoder firmware loading also seems to
require manipulation of various GPIO signals.  As a Linux driver
author, there's a certain amount of guesswork needed to figure this
out.  So the debug interface here includes the ability to directly
access GPIO signals.</P>

<P>In our case, there are 3 GPIO registers of interest: an input
register, an output register, and a direction register.  Generally
(there is one important exception), each bit of each register
corresponds to a specific GPIO.  For example, bit 11 of each register
corresponds to hardware GPIO bit 11.  The direction register control
the in vs out setting of each bit.  Reading the input register reads
all the GPIO states, while writing the output register sets the GPIO
states (for all GPIOs that are set as outputs).</P>

<P>Setting a bit in the direction register sets the corresponding GPIO
as an output bit.  There is one exception here for our hardware
however:  GPIO bits 0 through 7 are treated as a unit in the direction
register, controlled by direction register bit 7.  Said another way,
setting bit 7 in the direction register programs all of GPIO bits 0
through 7 as outputs; cleaing direction register bit 7 programs all of
GPIO bits 0 through 7 as inputs.  Best I can tell right now is that
direction register bits 0 through 6 simply have no effect.</P>

<P>So, suppose you wish to clear GPIO bit 11.  To do this, you first
must ensure that bit position 11 in the direction register has a 1 in
it, then put a 0 in bit position 11 of the output register.</P>

<P>To read current GPIO states, just read debugcmd itself; part of the
output includes all GPIO states.</P>

<P>With all that said, here are the debug interface commands to
control GPIO signals:</P>

<DL>

<DT><code>gpio dir &lt;mask&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code></DT><DD>This
command controls the direction register.  The &lt;mask&gt; argument
specifies which bits you wish to modify in the register.  The
&lt;value&gt; argument specifies new bit values for those bits that
were set in the &lt;mask&gt;.</DD>

<DT><code>gpio out &lt;mask&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code></DT><DD>This
command controls the output register.  The &lt;mask&gt; argument
specifies which bits you wish to modify in the register.  The
&lt;value&gt; argument specifies new bit values for those bits that
were set in the &lt;mask&gt;.</DD>
</DL>

<P>There is no command to control the input register - it is a
read-only register and its value is always provided as part of the
output when reading the &quot;<tt>debugcmd</tt>&quot; file itself.</P>

<P>The argument values are expected to be integers.  But since they
are interpreted as bit mask combinations you will naturally want to
use hex values here.  Just use the usual C language convention of
prefixing 0x to the number and that will have the desired effect.</P>

<P>Given the above and revisiting our example, then to clear GPIO bit
11, the following commands would be issued:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><code>
echo &quot;gpio dir 0x0800 0x0800&quot; &gt;debugcmd
<br>
echo &quot;gpio out 0x0800 0x0000&quot; &gt;debugcmd
</code></BLOCKQUOTE>
