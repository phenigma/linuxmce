<P>Mike Isely &lt;isely at pobox dot com&gt;</P>

<P>This page describes issues involving the pvrusb2 driver's use of
the tveeprom module that is both a part of Vidoe4Linux and ivtv.
Unfortunately these two implementations are somewhat divergent and can
cause problems when used with the <A HREF="pvrusb2.html">pvrusb2</A>
driver distribution.</P>

<P>If you find you are having problems that involve tveeprom.ko or are
experiencing problems involving the correct determination of your PVR
USB2 device's configuration, then you might be getting victimized by
issues with tveeprom.  You probably should read everything below
before asking any questions...</P>

<P>You can find the main pvrusb2 driver page on the web at <A
HREF="http://www.isely.net/pvrusb2/pvrusb2.html">http://www.isely.net/pvrusb2/pvrusb2.html</A>.</P>

<HR>
<H2>Background</H2>

<P>The PVR USB2 device contains within it a block of data that helps
drivers determine how best to control the device.  This information,
typically held inside a I2C-accessed PROM device, needs to be
retrieved by the driver during initialization.  Information contained
therein can include any of:</P>

<UL>
<LI>RF tuner type</LI>
<LI>Supported video standard(s)</LI>
<LI>Audio processor type</LI>
<LI>Device serial number</LI>
<LI>Device model information</LI>
<LI>Device revision info</LI>
</UL>

<P>In the case of the pvrusb2 driver, we're specifically interested
in the tuner type, set of support video standards (there may be more
than one), and the device's serial number.  We can probably live
without the serial number or supported video standards (just assume
them all), but we really really need that tuner type.  Hauppauge seems
to like changing out tuners within a product without telling anyone,
and we have to be able to recognize and handle that situation.</P>

<P>It turns out that with apparently all Hauppauge TV tuner products,
a common data format is used within all embedded PROMs.  Thus it
becomes possible to write a parser for that data a single time and
have it be useful to many different drivers.  That is indeed the case
within Video4Linux; it provides a module known as <tt>tveeprom.ko</tt>
which parses Hauppauge PROM data.  So, for the pvrusb2 driver to
retrieve data from the device's PROM, it's just a simple matter of
using <tt>tveeprom.ko</tt> to do the work, right?  Well read on...</P>

<HR>
<H2>tveeprom.ko</H2>

<H3>Theory and Reality</H3>

<P>The <tt>tveeprom.ko</tt> module (we'll just call it tveeprom from
here on out) is designed to operate as a typical I2C client driver
within Video4Linux.  When loaded into the kernel, it will register
itself as a chip driver, and as I2C buses are registered it will check
each bus for the presence of a PROM and if found it will attach itself
to that bus and make available its command interface for any
interested parties.  When asked via that command interface, tveeprom
will read in the contents of the associated PROM, parse the contents,
and hand back the results to the caller in a structure.</P>

<P>The tveeprom module, in an ideal world, is really doing 3 things
here:</P>

<OL>
<LI>It is detecting the presence of the PROM chip.</LI>
<LI>It is reading the entire contents of the PROM chip.</LI>
<LI>It is parsing the contents to find data of interest.</LI>
</OL>

<P>In an ideal world, those three things will always work perfectly
and will never need to change...</P>

<P>But things are not this simple.  A number of factors seriously
complicate the operation of this module.  First and most aggravating
is that incompatible variations of this module exist in v4l and ivtv -
how do we use tveeprom in pvrusb2 if we're not sure which module has
been loaded?  Another problem is that while tveeprom does a great job
of parsing the PROM contents, it doesn't do so well at detecting the
PROM nor correctly reading the area that needs to be parsed.  A number
of issues like this conspire to make it very difficult to reliably use
this module.</P>

<H3>tveeprom variants</H3>

<P>For starters, there is more than one tveeprom floating around in
Linux - there's one version provided by v4l and another version
provided by the out-of-tree ivtv driver.  While the two versions may
have a common ancestor, they are forked code and have recently
diverged.  (Yes, I know that there is an effort underway to bring this
back together, but that doesn't change what I've recently
observed.)</P>

<P>The pvrusb2 driver does not really want to get into the business of
implementing a third variation of this module, nor does it want to
re-implement what has already been done elsewhere.  Thus the pvrusb2
driver is designed to (attempt to) work with either variant of
tveeprom.  Being able to stay compatible with both variants is proving
to be quite a challenge.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Note: the tveeprom.ko built as part of pvrusb2 is not
another variant.  It is an exact mirror of tveeprom.c taken from a
recent snapshot of ivtv.  I have hit situations in the past where the
v4l implementation of tveeprom causes problems (e.g. not correctly
mapping a particular tuner type).  Rather than require everyone to
then also find and install ivtv, the pvrusb2 driver snapshot contains
copies of a few modules (like tveeprom) from ivtv.  These files are
unmodified, and kept up-to-date whenever possible.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>tveeprom alternate API</H3>

<P>Earlier it was mentioned that tveeprom really does 3 things,
detection, retrieval, and parsing.  That third thing is exported
outside of tveeprom with a direct subroutine entry point.  Its
prototype is basically this:</P>

<code><pre>void tveeprom_hauppauge_analog(struct tveeprom *tvee,unsigned char *eeprom_data);</pre></code>

<P>(Starting with the v4l variant kernel 2.6.14, this function has
changed to expect an additional <tt>struct i2c_client</tt> pointer as
the first argument, with the other arguments shifted down.  The
implementation uses this pointer to emit additional information when
printing to the log.)</P>

<P>By calling this entry point directly rather than using the I2C
command interface, it becomes up to the user to detect the PROM and
read the appropriate contents.  The results are returned inside of the
<tt>tveeprom</tt> structure, which provides more information than
would otherwise be possible with the I2C command interface method.
Using this direct call, we can retrieve the device's stored serial
number, which can't be had any other way.</P>

<P>For all further discussion, we'll refer to the I2C command
interface way of retrieving data as the &quot;indirect method&quot;
and this direct call means of retrieving data as the &quot;direct
method&quot;.  (Note: as of 20051231, the indirect method is
completely broken right now so don't even bother trying it...)</P>

<P>There is however a major downside to the direct method: It is an
unstable API.  Though both v4l and ivtv variations of tveeprom provide
this method, they use different and incompatible definitions for
<tt>struct tveeprom</tt>.  This makes it very difficult to compile a
driver that can use either variation of tveeprom - which <tt>struct
tveeprom</tt> definition do you use?</P>

<HR>
<H2>pvrusb2 handling of tveeprom</H2>

<P>The pvrusb2 driver, not wanting to foreclose any choices, attempts
to support both indirect and direct methods using either variation of
tveeprom available.  This does not work well in every combination.  In
fact right now, the indirect method does not even work at all for your
author here (and as of the 20051231 snapshot the indirect method is
currently broken anyway), and the direct method requires an ugly,
disgusting, sickening hack in order to operate correctly.</P>

<P>The choice of indirect versus direct method is determined by the
<tt>PVR2_EEPROM_INDIRECT</tt> macro (or
<tt>PVRUSB2_EEPROM_DIRECT_CALL</tt> macro for snapshots older than
20051113), which is used within <tt>pvrusb2-eeprom.c</tt>.  Based on
this macro, one of two versions of the function
<tt>pvr2_eeprom_analyze()</tt> are compiled into the pvrusb2 driver.
As shipped, the direct method is selected by default (since it is the
method that actually works for all known cases).  If you want to try
the indirect method, you'll need to edit <tt>pvrusb2-eeprom.c</tt> to
enable or disable the macro as appropriate, and then rebuild the
driver.</P>

<blockquote>Actually, post 20051113, the above is not quite exactly
true.  There are now <em>three</em> versions of
<tt>pvr2_eeprom_analyze()</tt> implemented.  The direct method now has
two implementations.  They are selected through the use of the
<tt>PVR2_EEPROM_IVTV</tt> macro.  Basically, the extra version comes
into play when this macro is not defined; it doesn't do any of the
hackish junk described below.  It instead assumes that it is always
always working with a V4L-provided tveeprom.ko, and is intended that
this non-hacked version will find its way into a V4L resident version
of this driver.  For the sake of everything discussed below, consider
that <tt>PVR2_EEPROM_IVTV</tt> is defined. </blockquote>

<P>Probably the best way to describe the problems here is just to walk
through the choices and see where that leads us.  Have your painkiller
ready...</P>

<H3>Using the indirect method</H3>

<P>Clearly, the ideal method should be the ideal choice, and that
method appears to be the indirect method.  Why go to all the work to
detect and read the PROM when the tveeprom module is clearly designed
to do this for you?  It's supported by both tveeprom variants and
should work the same in both cases.  This has in fact been implemented
in the function <tt>pvr2_eeprom_analyze()</tt> in
<tt>pvrusb2-eeprom.c</tt> within the driver but left disabled.  Here's
what <em>should</em> happen if you enable it:</P>

<OL>

<LI>The tveeprom module will be called to scan the pvrusb2's I2C bus
when the device is plugged in.</LI>

<LI>The tveeprom module will find the PROM and attach itself to the
bus.  The pvrusb2 driver will notice this and remember the client for
future use.</LI>

<LI>The pvrusb2 driver as part of its initialization will ask tveeprom
to read the PROM and parse the results into a small data structure
which is then given back to the pvrusb2 driver.</LI>

<LI>The pvrusb2 driver will read that small data structure to learn
the tuner type, supported video formats and serial number of the
device.</LI>

</OL>

<P>What really happens unfortunately is quite a bit different...</P>

<blockquote>

<P>At step 2, tveeprom fails to detect the PROM.  This is a problem on
my PVR USB2 at least.  An investigation of the cause suggests that the
PROM in my device simply won't ack an I2C write of zero length (this
is the type of operation which the I2C core uses to detect connected
devices).  My knowledge of I2C says that the device actually has to
ack before the transfer length is known so this should be impossible.
But there it is.  My suspicion is that the &quot;proxy&quot; I2C
implementation that we operate in the device's 8051 controller may be
causing a problem here, but changing that firmware is out of the scope
of this driver, so I have to accept that we can't detect the device.
This problem can however be worked around by providing options to the
tveeprom module to force recognition of the PROM part.  Specifying for
example &quot;<tt>force=-1,80</tt>&quot; will get past this
problem.</P>

<P>At step 3, reading of the entire PROM fails because tveeprom tries
to read 256 bytes in one single operation - but the I2C adapter proxy
implementation over USB to the 8051 can't transfer that much data at a
time.  I've worked around this in the I2C adapter driver within the
pvrusb2 driver by fragmenting oversized transfers into smaller pieces.
However this really isn't clean since the fragments become separate
transfers on the bus, and that might cause other problems.  But for
this purpose fragmenting the transfers gets around the problem.</P>

<P>At step 3, parsing of the entire PROM's contents fails because it
appears that in the PVR USB2 device's PROM data, only the upper 128
bytes contain valid data.  Unfortunately, the parsing algorithm in
tveeprom just gives up as soon as it sees what it thinks is corrupted
data.  There is no work-around for this.  Since tveeprom in this
method is controlling the actual PROM reading operation, there is no
way to limit what it reads.</P>

<P>At step 4, the data provided by the official command interface
doesn't actually provide all of the data.  There is no way to use this
interface to retrieve the device's serial number.</P>

</blockquote>

<P>I have seen two reports on the pvrusb2 mailing list that suggest
that detection probably does work for some people.  Perhaps it depends
on the particular PROM chip that Hauppauge has used on a particular
production run.</P>

<P>I have also modified the driver to not require a device serial
number - sysfs needed it to generate a class path but if there is no
serial number then a unit number will be used instead.</P>

<P>I have also modified the driver to handle large I2C transfers by
fragmenting such large blocks into smaller transfers.</P>

<P>Given all of the above, then the only issue really standing in the
way of using the &quot;indirect&quot; method here is that of
accidentally trying to parse the lower 128 bytes of the PROM.  I
suppose it's conceivable that there are PVR USB2 devices out there
which might have fully parseable PROM contents.  If you think you have
such a device, then you can probably try enabling the indirect method
in pvrusb2-eeprom.c, rebuilding, and everything should work.</P>

<P>Otherwise, the indirect method just isn't an option for this driver.</P>

<P>By the way, if you see messages like this in your system log:</P>

<blockquote><pre>tveeprom 2-0050: Encountered bad packet header [c2]. Corrupt or not a Hauppauge eeprom.</pre></blockquote>

<P>yet the device works just fine, then you're probably seeing
tveeprom attempting the indirect method on its own and failing.
That's a strong hint that the pvrusb2 driver will stop correctly
reading the PROM if you try to switch to the indirect method.</P>

<H3>Using the direct method</H3>

<P>It should be pretty clear from the preceding section that using the
normal I2C command interface &quot;indirect&quot; method to retrieve
device configuration data just isn't going to work for the pvrusb2
driver.  It's a shame too, because the indirect method is a stable
interface and it &quot;works&quot; the same way regardless of which
tveeprom variant has actually been loaded into the kernel.</P>

<P>The showstopper problem with the indirect method is that it is
reading too much of the PROM.  In the case of the PVR USB2, only the
upper 128 bytes seem to contain useful data.  Thus we have to resort
to the &quot;direct&quot; method for data retrieval.</P>

<P>Unfortunately the direct method has its own problems.  Unlike the
indirect method, the direct method's interface is not stable.
Currently (as of kernel 2.6.14 and ivtv 0.4.0) that critical
<tt>struct tveeprom</tt>, which defines all the fields we can
retrieve, is radically different between the two variants of the
tveeprom module.  In fact, in the ivtv variant, the struct is
completely private to the <tt>tveeprom.c</tt> module source file.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In fact, if your kernel is built with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS
enabled, the above mentioned interface incompatibility causes an
nastier problem, which you'll know you have if you see a message like
&quot;pvrusb2 disagrees about version of symbol
tveeprom_hauppauge_analog&quot; in your system log.  Rather than
repeat the explanation for that here, please see the <A
HREF="faq.html#Q19">FAQ item</A> that discusses this
issue.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Another incompatible change was made to
<tt>tveeprom_hauppauge_analog()</tt> in kernel 2.6.14 - an argument
was added.  There is a new first argument to the function which is the
<tt>i2c_client</tt> structure that had been used to retrieve the PROM
contents.  (All that <tt>tveeprom_hauppauge_analog()</tt> uses this
for is to enhance the printk's going to the kernel log.)  Fortunately,
ivtv 0.4.0's version of this function will also expect this argument
if compiled under kernel 2.6.14 so the impact of that change is
lessened somewhat.</P>

<P>The pvrusb2 driver's implementation for the direct method (also
implemented in the function <tt>pvr2_eeprom_analyze()</tt> in
<tt>pvrusb2-eeprom.c</tt>) doesn't have to detect the PROM since it
knows it has to be there.  It will also only read the upper 128 bytes
of PROM data, thus avoiding the issue that kills the indirect method.
But that so far is just piker stuff....</P>

<P>If the pvrusb2 driver is compiled for kernel 2.6.14, then
<tt>pvr2_eeprom_analyze()</tt> will assume the need for that extra
argument, and temporarily fake up an <tt>i2_client</tt> structure so
that <tt>tveeprom_hauppauge_analog()</tt> in v4l will continue to work
properly (the ivtv tveeprom implementation doesn't care).</P>

<P>That leaves just one problem, the worst problem: the conflicting
<tt>tveeprom</tt> structure defintion.  We really want to be able to
support either tveeprom variant, and we really want that to work at
run time not compile time.  Based on whichever tveeprom is loaded into
the kernel, we need to somehow know which &quot;tveeprom&quot; struct
definition to use in order to communicate with that module's data
parsing code.  After a lot of thought, I came up with something
completely sick, twisted, and disgusting.  But it works (well, only
when <A HREF="faq.html#Q19">CONFIG_MODVERSIONS</A> is not enabled in the kernel).  This is what
is implemented in <tt>pvr2_eeprom_analyze()</tt> in
<tt>pvrusb2-eeprom.c</tt> when the default direct method is
compiled:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Include <tt>&lt;media/tveeprom.h&gt;</tt> and also physically copy
the exact <tt>struct tveeprom</tt> declaration from the ivtv variant
of tveeprom, except we rename that structure to <tt>struct
tveeprom_ivtv</tt> in order to avoid the otherwise obvious name
conflict.</LI>

<LI>Instance a union of the two competing structures (call it
&quot;<tt>tvdata</tt>&quot;).  Fill the entire thing with obvious bad
values.  Pass the address of this <tt>tvdata</tt> union to
<tt>tveeprom_hauppauge_analog()</tt> in place of the normal
<tt>tveeprom</tt> structure.</LI>

<LI>Scan the <tt>tvdata</tt> structure afterwards, from back to front,
looking to see at what offset data was first modified.</LI>

<LI>From the determined offset, calculate the actual size of the
structure that <tt>tveeprom_hauppauge_analog()</tt> assumed and
modified.  Compare that size with the size of the two union variants
and from that determine which union variant (i.e. which <tt>struct
tveeprom</tt> definition) was the correct one.</LI>

<LI>Extract and remember data from the correctly chosen variant.</LI>

</OL>

<P>Logically what is going on here is that since we don't know which
structure definition to use, we'll just use them both.  They are both
being simultaneously passed in to <tt>tveeprom_hauppauge_analog()</tt>
as members of a union.  Before making that function call, we seed the
data structure so we can tell what's been changed afterwards.  By
noting the changes afterwards, we can make a reasonable guess as to
which <tt>tveeprom</tt> definition
<tt>tveeprom_hauppauge_analog()</tt> has assumed and then act on the
data accordingly.</P>

<P>This is ugly, repulsive, and revolting.  However I see no other way
short of telling everyone that either (1) this driver can't be used
concurrently with ivtv, or (2) one must replace tveeprom.c in the
kernel (or ivtv) with ivtv's version (or the kernel's version) before
anything is going to work.  (And of course as said earlier, even this
hack won't work if you have <A
HREF="faq.html#Q19">CONFIG_MODVERSIONS</A> enabled in your
kernel.)</P>

<HR>
<H2>Restoring Sanity</H2>

<P>Clearly the tveeprom module is useful to drivers outside of ivtv,
and to that end, there really only should be a single official version
of it in the Video4Linux core within the kernel sources.  Not having
an official version causes the implementation to diverge over time,
which is the principle cause of that disgusting hack described above
with the direct method.</P>

<P>Even with a single official tveeprom version, the (apparent)
official indirect API is insufficient.  I'm not sure what the right
answer here is.  Certainly the indirect API should include commands to
retrieve other bits of data like the device serial number.  But even
with that in place, device detection can be difficult, and the module
is going to have to deal with situations where apparently not all of
the PROM contents contains parseable data.</P>

<P>If it is not possible to make the indirect interface work for
everyone, then the direct interface needs to be stabilized.</P>

<P>Hopefully everything stated here should help you to understand the
issues behind reading of the PVR USB2 device's PROM and thus maybe
hopefully will help you to help me work out any further issues that
come up in this area of the driver...</P>
