<H3><A NAME="Q1">1. When I try to install the driver with &quot;make
install&quot; the installation fails.</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
That's because I screwed up when reworking the build process with the
20050527 snapshot.  We're using Kbuild and the correct internal target
is "modules_install" not "install".  Previous snapshots should be OK
because they predate the bug.  Anything after 20050527 should be OK
because it's been fixed.  Note that in any case if you follow the
procedure on the pvrusb2.html, then you're copying the modules by hand
anyway, in which case this isn't an issue.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q2">2. Why am I not getting any sound?</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There are multiple possible causes for this problem.  Check the
following:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Is <TT>msp3400.ko</TT> present and loaded?  Try <TT>lsmod | grep
msp3400</TT>.  The pvrusb2 driver itself does not directly control the
sound processor; instead that duty is offloaded to <TT>msp3400.ko</TT>
which is included with video4linux (and the ivtv driver and for
completeness there's a spare copy included with the driver snapshot).
You need to ensure that <TT>msp3400.ko</TT> can be loaded.  The driver
will attempt to pull it in via modprobe when the driver itself is
loaded, but any failure of that attempt will be silent (literally and
figuratively).  If it isn't there, then either rebuild your kernel
with the module enabled within video4linux or ensure that you've
installed the spare copy included with this snapshot.</LI>

<LI>Did you just run xawtv and now you're trying to use mplayer (or
probably anything else that pulls mpeg video)?  In this case, xawtv
mutes the audio on exit, and it will <em>stay muted</em> if the next
application doesn't do anything to change the situation.  This is in
fact what will happen with mplayer if you run it in &quot;dumb&quot;
mode.  You can fix this by manually unmuting the sound using the sysfs
interface.  Turn off the &quot;mute&quot; control (and see the main
pvrusb2 web page for information on how to use the sysfs
interface).</LI>

<LI>Is the driver's audio volume too low?  Check that your app
(e.g. xawtv) has the volume up.</LI>

<LI>Check your mixer settings.  Make sure your pcm channel is unmuted
and the volume is high enough.</LI>

<LI>It's possible (with newer driver snapshots) that your hardware
needs <TT>tda9887.ko</TT> loaded and attached.  If this module isn't
in your <TT>lsmod</TT> output, load it and see if that makes a
difference.  If it is in your <TT>lsmod</TT> output (and especially if
you are a PAL user), you <em>might</em> need to tweak the module's
configuration.  Please see <A HREF="tda9887.html">tda9887.html</A> for
more information.</LI>

</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q3">3. Why can't I get this driver to work on an xbox?</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The problem is that the xbox has an I2C adapter controller in the xbox
Linux software that is very hostile to the presence of other I2C
busses showing up in the system.  The pvrusb2 hardware has an internal
I2C bus.  The fix for this is to patch the xbox Linux software.
Contact me for a patch.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q4">4. The image is jumpy and the audio tends to lag.</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Possibly your system isn't keeping up with the driver's bit rate.
There are some things you can do to determine what is going on:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Run <TT>top</TT> while running your app.  How much CPU is left
over?  If you have less than about 20% CPU left (approx guess), then
I'd suggest you need a faster system.</LI>

<LI>Is the pvrusb2 device really connected to a USB2.0 controller and
/ or hub?  Run <TT>usbview</TT> to inspect the device and see what
rate it is going at.  You may have problems if you are only running
the device at USB 1.1 &quot;hi-speed&quot; rate.</LI>

<LI>Try tweaking the video rendering settings of your app.  For
example, with mplayer, the "xv" output setting uses the XVideo
extension and tries to do hardware video scaling - if your video card
doesn't do hardware scaling very well, then the CPU could be getting
taxed.  Try the "x11" output setting and see if things improve.  (In
this case, <TT>top</TT> will likely reveal that you're gassing out the
CPU.)</LI>

<LI>Separate the video capture operation from the video rendering
operation and see which side is taking all the CPU: Try just cat'ing
/dev/video0 (or whatever the pvrusb2 device got assign) into a file.
Then view that file in a separate step with mplayer.  Look at the CPU
utilization (e.g. use <TT>top</TT>) during both steps and see which
part is taking all the CPU.</LI>

</UL>

<P>It is possible to have a very fast system but still have lousy
video rendering performance.  Good video rendering depends <em>a
lot</em> on the video card you are using.  For example I have found
that Nvidia 5200-class video cards do hardware video scaling
significantly better than ATI 9200-class video cards.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q5">5. I can't tune anything.  I get either video snow or
a blank screen.</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There are multiple possible causes for this problem.  Check the
following:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Is <TT>tuner.ko</TT> present and loaded?  Try <TT>lsmod | grep
tuner</TT>.  The pvrusb2 driver itself does not directly control the
tuner; instead that duty is offloaded to <TT>tuner.ko</TT> which is
included with video4linux (and the ivtv driver and for completeness
there's a spare copy included with the driver snapshot).  You need to
ensure that <TT>tuner.ko</TT> can be loaded.  The driver will attempt
to pull it in via modprobe when the driver itself is loaded, but any
failure of that attempt will be silent.  If it isn't there, then
either rebuild your kernel with the module enabled within video4linux
or ensure that you've installed the spare copy included with this
snapshot.</LI>

<LI>

You might have a Hauppauge "type 58" tuner in your pvrusb2.  Some
versions of <TT>tveeprom.ko</TT> floating around don't correctly map
this to a type that <TT>tuner.ko</TT> can use - which then causes
<TT>tuner.ko</TT> to give up trying to control your tuner.  Do you see
something like this in your system log?<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>tveeprom: tuner = Philips FM1236 MK3 (idx = 58, type = 4)</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If you do, then you have a type 58 tuner and it isn't being mapped
properly (the mapped value &quot;type = 4&quot; part indicates a bad
mapping.  Definitely if you are using the <TT>tveeprom.ko</TT> that is
part of your kernel tree then this may be a problem.  Try using the
<TT>tveeprom.ko</TT> module that is part of this driver snapshot.  The
main pvrusb2 web page has more information about this.

</LI>

<LI>It's possible (with newer driver snapshots) that your hardware
needs <TT>tda9887.ko</TT> loaded and attached.  If this module isn't
in your <TT>lsmod</TT> output, load it and see if that makes a
difference.  If it is in your <TT>lsmod</TT> output (and especially if
you are a PAL user), you <em>might</em> need to tweak the module's
configuration.  Please see <A HREF="tda9887.html">tda9887.html</A> for
more information.</LI>

<LI>You might have a tuner that is more recent than can be recognized
by <TT>tveeprom.ko</TT> and / or <TT>tuner.ko</TT>.  So far I know of
no instances of this particular problem, but it can happen.  This is a
more general variant of the "type 58" problem above.  Try to locate
and use later versions of <TT>tuner.ko</TT> and <TT>tveeprom.ko</TT> -
and <em>please</em> tell me if this happens.</LI>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q6">6. I can't get xawtv to work.</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There are multiple possible causes for this problem.  Check the
following:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Any version of xawtv before 4.x has no chance - those earlier
versions could not decode an mpeg2 stream.  Update to something in 4.x
if you are trying an older verison.</LI>

<LI>You might not have compiled xawtv correctly.  If the configuration
step didn't find ffmpeg (I think) then it won't compile in any mpeg2
decoding logic and then you're no better off that a 3.x version.
Similarly, it has to find and configure an mp3 decoder in order to
correctly decode the audio.</LI>

<LI>You might have a broken 4.x xawtv snapshot.  Versions from early
February 2005 are known to work (been using that as a test case).
However there was a video streaming bug found & fixed around
20-May-2005 that would have prevented snapshots prior to that from
working properly (and I guess since my Feb version worked, the bug
must have been introduced into the code some time after that
point).</LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q7">7. I can't get mplayer to work.</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Even though this driver is a video4linux driver, and mplayer is
able to handle video4linux devices, you can't run mplayer against this
driver in such a way that mplayer tries to treat it as a video4linux
device.  What happens when you try is that mplayer (1) can't grok v4l
frames as mpeg2 data, and (2) even if it could, mplayer tries to use
<TT>mmap()</TT> style I/O to fetch the video &quot;frames&quot; and
that is not currently supported by the pvrusb2 driver.</P>

<P>The way to make mplayer work is just to not do anything special.
Specify your video device name (e.g. <TT>/dev/video0</TT>) as the
&quot;file&quot; to read - mplayer will then happily stream plain old
mpeg2 data from the device.  Yes, I know that means you can't use
mplayer to adjust the device's controls, like for example changing the
channel.  However you can still use the driver's sysfs interface to do
this while mplayer is running.</P>

<P>Another alternative solution you can try is the patched mplayer
available with the ivtv driver.  I haven't tried this, but I suspect
the ivtv driver author patched mplayer to deal with exactly the
problems I describe above.  Thus if it works for ivtv it may very well
also work for the pvrusb2 driver.  (Please tell me if you try this and
let me know if it worked.)</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q8">8. I can't compile because <TT>tveeprom.h</TT> is
missing or the compilation dies with a complaint about <TT>tvdata</TT>
being an incomplete type.</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The <TT>tvdata</TT> structure is defined in <TT>tveeprom.h</TT> so
the common solution is to find <TT>tveeprom.h</TT>.  That header file
is part of your kernel source tree.  If it isn't there, then your
kernel sources are too old to work with this driver.  Update your
kernel.  Alternatively you can probably also work with a slightly
older kernel that has been patched up with the latest video4linux
snapshot.  However I really recommend you go to a later kernel.  A
good choice known to work is 2.6.11.10.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q9">9. I'm getting errors in the log about being unable
to find <TT>pvrusb2.f1</TT> or <TT>pvrusb2.f2</TT>.</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those two files are the firmware images that must be loaded into
the pvrusb2 hardware before it will work properly.  The firmware is
<em>not</em> part of this snapshot, but you can extract it from your
Windows drivers - which you should have gotten with the device.  The
extraction process is described <A HREF="firmware.html">here.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q10">10. I copied the driver module(s) into my system but
the kernel is not loading them.</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You might have compiled for the wrong kernel version.  The kernel
loader will usually report this in a very unsubtle way in the system
log.</P>

<P>If the kernel is complaining that it can't find the module, you
might want to try this first:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>depmod -a</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I leave it as an exercise to the reader to look up the man page for
<TT>depmod</TT> to see why this is important :-)</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q11">11. Sometimes streaming quits in xawtv.</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This problem was mostly fixed as of the 20050626 snapshot of the
driver.  Are you using a recent enough snapshot?</P>

<P>The remaining issues right now I consider to be xawtv application
issues.  These problems include:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Zero byte read requests - Sometimes xawtv will issue a read to the
driver of size zero.  Why?  I have no idea.  When this happens, the
only thing the driver can do is return zero, but that is really an
EOF, and xawtv responds by closing the stream.  The driver will detect
and report zero byte read requests to the system log.  Look for
messages of this form: &quot;ZERO Request? Returning zero.&quot;</LI>

<LI>If you are tuned to a weak station, video streaming can pause, due
apparently to the pvrusb2 hardware struggling to acquire a lock on the
video frames.  If this pause is long enough (about 3 seconds) then
xawtv will timeout with a &quot;select timeout&quot;.  There really
isn't much the driver can do here when this happens.  Instead xawtv
should not give up reading.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Any time streaming quits in xawtv, you can always restart it by
doing something that causes xawtv to stop then start again.  Changing
the channel for example is a way to kick the streaming going again.</P>

 </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q12">12. Where the heck is <tt>/dev/input/event</tt>X for
my device?</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There isn't any such device node entry for this driver.  Aurelien's
older driver directly integrated with the kernel's input system for IR
processing; I removed all that logic in favor of allowing the lirc
package to do the work of handling the IR processing.  When you use
lirc, input is captured differently, thus no
<tt>/dev/input/event</tt>X will be found for this driver.  More info
about this is described <A HREF="usage.html#IR_handling">here</A>.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q13">13. Why did the device go batty when my air
conditioning turned on?</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This is because your air conditioning compressor caused a temporary
sag in your line power.  While modern PC power supplies are pretty
good at surviving such power abuse, your PVR USB2 device is externally
powered using a cheap wall-wart which just can't defend against a
power sag.  So the result is a power glitch into the tuner's hardware
and that can screw up video capture.</P>

<P>This sort of issue is not unique to the PVR USB2 device - it can
happen for any device which has a separate external power supply
(which would be typical of many USB devices).  If this is a problem
for you, get a UPS and plug your PVR USB2 device into it (along with
the PC of course).</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q14">14. Why must I be root to access the control files
in sysfs?</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Files created in sysfs are initialized with a default user and
group ids of root.  There's no way to initialize them to anything
else.  Now, though the driver can't set the uid or gid, the driver can
set the mode for each sysfs file it creates.  So why not just make the
files world writable?  Because that would violate the security of the
system.  The simple fact is that there are things one can tweak here
that would probably cause the driver to fail, which might be a way to
destablize the system.  (No, I don't know that for certain, but when
you don't know, the correct action is really to not allow it in the
first place.)  Just accept the fact that for the same reason that
permissions should be restricted for access, to say your CD burner,
that it should not be possible for just anyone to write information or
otherwise control the pvrusb2 driver.  That is why only root can
access the control files in sysfs.</P>

<P>Now, with that said, there are other possibilities.  While it
should not be the business of the pvrusb2 driver to set fine grained
security policy, there's no reason why one couldn't do other things in
user space to solve the problem.  Some possibilities include:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Have a simple setuid wrapper program manipulate sysfs, based on
sanitized commands given to it.  The wrapper then effectively becomes
the security cop.</LI>

<LI>Modify the uid and gid of desired sysfs files from user space.
You can chown / chgrp files directly.  Perhaps you can set up
designated &quot;video&quot; group whose members are permitted to
touch the device.</LI>

<LI>Program hotplug to adjust uids and/or gids for the driver's sysfs
when it sees the device appear in the system.  Such a script could
implement a distribution-specific security policy, much like what is
done for other devices (e.g. scanners).  This is a refinement of the
previous idea.  If someone would like to contribute something to do
this I can include it in the driver source tree.</LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q15">15. I just added a second PVR USB2 and now the video
is stuttering, corrupted and/or unstable.</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Beyond instancing itself again, the driver doesn't have to do
anything special to support multiple devices.  So it should &quot;just
work&quot;.</P>

<P>However there can be hardware issues with such a configuration.
The thing to watch out for is how you have your device(s) connected to
the computer.  If everything is using USB 2.0 running at hi-speed,
then you should be fine (and if you are not contact me).  A single PVR
USB2 device plugged into a &quot;full speed&quot; USB 1.1 port will
also work fine, but since &quot;full speed&quot; is at best 12mbps and
your average mpeg2 stream is going to be around 6mbps or higher, then
a second PVR USB2 device sharing that connection through a hub is
going to cause trouble.  There just isn't enough USB bandwidth in this
case.  If you are going to run multiple PVR USB2 devices, make sure
that each has enough bandwidth available between it and the PC.
Generally this means that if you are going to share a port using a
hub, the hub at least must be a hi-speed hub and it must be connected
to a hi-speed port.</P>

<P>Note that you can dump out the <tt>ctl_usb_speed</tt> control in
sysfs for each device to find out what speed it thinks it is running
at.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q16">16. Changing the balance, bass or treble doesn't have
any effect.</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Handling of the various audio tone / balance settings is not
directly implemented by the pvrusb2 driver.  It just passes everything
through to <tt>msp3400.ko</tt> for processing, and that module
processes the settings into commands for the msp34xx chip inside the
device.  The problem here (at least for me and probably everyone) is
that the particular msp34xx variant inside the PVR USB2 doesn't have
the ability to adjust any of the balance, bass, or treble.  The
<tt>msp3400.ko</tt> tries to act like the capability is there, but it
just doesn't work because it isn't implemented in the silicon.  That's
why it probably isn't working for you.</P>

<P>This of course leads to the obvious question: If it isn't going to
work, then why do the controls exist in the driver?  Answer: Because
I'm not sure that it isn't going to work.  It is conceivable that
there might be some PVR USB2 variants floating around that happen to
have the right kind of msp34xx part to implement this.  Given
Hauppauge's penchant for changing out parts without changing models,
I'm not prepared to assume that the ability won't be there.  So the
driver makes these controls available and dutifully passes that
information down to <tt>msp3400.ko</tt> which in turn tries to influence
the (apparently) non-existent functionality.  What would really be
nice would be for <tt>msp3400.ko</tt> to provide a means to detect if
balance / bass / treble are supported and to tell the parent driver
this information.  Then I could disable controls that obviously aren't
going to work.  But that ability as far as I can tell isn't there, and
for now I'm going to assume that it <em>might</em> be there.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q17">17. Changing the audio mode (stereo / mono / sap)
doesn't do anything!</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>After a night of bug chasing, I believe I understand this problem,
and it only affects those of us in NTSC territory.</P>

<P>Again, this is a case where the pvrusb2 driver just passes the
information down to <tt>msp3400.ko</tt> and it's up to that module to
act on the information to implement the correct mode.  There's very
little that the pvrusb2 driver can do to foul this up.</P>

<P>For all areas except NTSC there are 2 possible audio subchannels
(I'm guessing this), and the msp34xx chip has the ability to select
combinations of those two within a given mode.  But with NTSC there
are actually 3 possible audio subchannels that can be broadcast at the
same time (stereo left, stereo right, sap), and the msp34xx chip has
to handle this by pre-selecting a subset based on the mode setting.
There are two NTSC &quot;modes&quot; because of this, so when
switching between either stereo or sap one has to switch this mode in
addition to switching the source.  Unfortunately the implementation in
<tt>msp3400.ko</tt> fails to do this.  It just locks onto the first
mode which selects the stereo choice.  Given that many people using
this module do not live in an NTSC area (I presume), this problem has
probably gone unnoticed.  I imagine that the ivtv driver likely has
the same issue.</P>

<P>The fix for this needs to be in <tt>msp3400.ko</tt>, which I don't
maintain.  When switching to/from sap, the mode has to be manually
switched to/from 0x0020 (BTSC stereo) and 0x0021 (BTSC sap).  It might
be possible to force this by disabling automatic mode selection in the
mode and forcing video standard code 0x0021 on the module's option
line, but I haven't tried this and it's really clunky to try to
operate the tuner in this manner.  If someone else would like to look
into this, I would welcome the effort.</P>

<P>At some point in the future I may try to code a fix for this, but
now isn't the time.  There are two variants of this rather messy
<tt>msp3400.ko</tt> module already floating around (kernel and ivtv)
and I don't want to fork a 3rd version.  The versions I'm looking at
are already several months old.  Before attacking something like this
one would need to first go to bleeding edge versions and talk to the
corresponding maintainers.  I just don't have the time right now.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Q18">18. Should I be worried if I see a message about a
corrupt Hauppauge PROM?</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You might see a message in your system log that looks like this:</P>

<blockquote><pre>tveeprom 2-0050: Encountered bad packet header [c2]. Corrupt or not a Hauppauge eeprom.</pre></blockquote>

<P>Yet even with such an alarming thing in the log, the PVR USB2
device operates correctly.  This is because the <tt>tveeprom.ko</tt>
module is trying on its own to parse the PROM data in the PVR USB2 and
it frequently can't do that correctly without outside help.  Later on
the pvrusb2 driver will orchestrate that action, this time with the
correct results, therefore this warning message can be ignored.</P>

<P>This message is coming from a support module, not the pvrusb2
driver itself, and so the pvrusb2 driver can't do much to control its
appearance in the log.  The interested reader may wish to read all
about operation of tveeprom.ko, which is laid out in gory detail over
in <A HREF="eeprom.html">eeprom.html</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Q19">19. What's up with &quot;pvrusb2 disagrees about version of symbol tveeprom_hauppauge_analog&quot;?</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This is the result of an interaction between CONFIG_MODVERSIONS (a
kernel build option) and the horrid hacked up way in which the pvrusb2
driver attempts to deal with tveeprom.ko (see <A
HREF="eeprom.html">eeprom.html</A> for more about that
hack).</P>

<P>When CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is in use, the kernel build system
generates these per-symbol CRCs by taking into account every aspect
related to the symbol's declaration - like its argument types, the
definition of those argument types, the return type, etc.  This is
done for each symbol exported by a module (a definition) and for each
symbol that needs to be imported into a module (a declaration).  The
idea here is to make sure that the symbol has been defined in
precisely the same way it has been declared.  If the declaration and
definition disagree, then their CRCs won't match and the module loader
catches this, prints that nasty message and aborts the load of the
module in question.  Obviously if a symbol's declaration and
definition do not match, then there may be an incompatibility and this
is how the kernel CONFIG_MODVERSIONS mechanism prevents usage of
incompatible symbols.</P>

<P>For example, if I declare and call function <TT>foobar</TT> this
way:</P>

<PRE><CODE>
   void foobar(short abc, char *def);
</CODE></PRE>

<P>But the module actually defines foobar this way:</P>

<PRE><CODE>
   void foobar(char *def) {
 	/* whatever */
   }
</CODE></PRE>

<P>Obviously such a mismatched call will likely generate bad behavior
and possibly a kernel oops.  But since the CRC for <TT>foobar</TT>
stored in the module defining <TT>foobar</TT> won't match the CRC for
<TT>foobar</TT> stored in the module using foobar, the mismatch will
be caught and the kernel won't let you load that combination of
modules at the same time.</P

<P>In theory this all looks great.  But why, might you ask, is this
mechanism not working for <TT>tveeprom_hauppauge_analog</TT>?  That's
because we <em>really do</em> have conflicting definitions here.</P>

<P>Look back at my diatribe in <A HREF="eeprom.html">eeprom.html</A>,
and you'll see how I point out that the V4L defined version of this
function uses a <TT>struct tveeprom</TT> that is different than the
<TT>struct tveeprom</TT> used by the ivtv defined version of this
function.  The CRC generation algorithm is apparently using the full
definition of the <TT>tveeprom</TT> structure as input into the CRC
value.  Now, in pvrusb2-eeprom.c I do some really ugly hackery to make
a run time determination of which <TT>struct tveeprom</TT> is really
the correct one so the code is actually fairly safe.  But this sort of
thing still trips up the CRC generation.  It turns out that in the
pvrusb2 driver build, pvrusb2-eeprom.c will see the V4L defined
prototype for <TT>tveeprom_hauppauge_analog</TT> and <TT>struct
tveeprom</TT>, so the expected CRC will be the V4L version of the
function.  Thus we now see why we get this "disagrees about version of
symbol" error when we try to load the ivtv version of tveeprom.ko with
the other definition - and a different CRC.</P>

<P>Right now I don't see a good solution.  The simple fact is that I'm
trying to make the pvrusb2 driver survive a screwed up situation
between V4L and ivtv and there's only so much I can do here.  There's
really only two choices here: (1) Don't enable CONFIG_MODVERSIONS in
your kernel build (if you can), or (2) Don't bother trying to use the
tveeprom.ko supplied with the pvrusb2 driver.  I should also point out
here that the same problem should happen if you try to use the "real"
ivtv driver's tveeprom.ko, for exactly the same reason.  This means
that if you really do want ivtv to run co-resident with the pvrusb2
driver, then you are only really left with choice (1).</P>
