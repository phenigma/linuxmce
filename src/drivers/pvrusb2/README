This is the root of the pvrusb2 driver distribution.  The
subdirectories are:

  doc    - Contains various bits of documentation (HTML pages mainly)
  driver - Sources for pvrusb2 driver (but not the modules)
  ivtv   - Support modules for pvrusb2, copied from ivtv
  misc   - Stuff that doesn't fit anywhere else
  utils  - Things that aid in the use of the driver

Please look in the individual subdirectories for more information.
You will definitely need to build the contents of the driver
directory.

You ONLY need the ivtv directory if you are using a kernel version
older than 2.6.15 and you otherwise don't have the ivtv driver
installed in your system.  With 2.6.15 all needed modules are part of
the kernel now and in fact as of 2.6.16, the modules in the ivtv
directory no longer compile (and there's really no reason to fix them
since they're already in the kernel sources).  See the pvrusb2
documentation in the doc directory (setup.html) for more information
about when/if to use the ivtv part of this driver.

NOTE: Complete documentation on the driver is contained in the html
files within the doc directory; these are exactly the same as what is
on the web site at the time.  Please browse those files before asking
questions.
