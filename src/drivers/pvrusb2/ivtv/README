This directory contains a snapshot of the support modules that the
pvrusb2 driver needs in order to function.  These are all copies from
ivtv (as of ivtv 0.4.0).  All modules here are also separately
available in the main kernel tree as part of V4L (though these
versions are slightly different).  You can use either.  The modules
here are provided as a convenience in case you prefer the ivtv
versions but don't want to go grab that tarball.

IMPORTANT NOTE: As of the 2.6.16 kernel, these module no longer
compile correctly.  At this point I am NOT correcting these errors
since these same modules are already fully available as part of the
kernel tree as of 2.6.15 - and the kernel versions are more up-to-date
anyway.  The only reason I am leaving these here for the moment is so
that people using older kernels can still use the pvrusb2 driver.

To build these modules essentially amounts to just running "Make", but
you need the kernel source tree nearby and you will likely also want
to set a few controlling environment variables first in order to link
things up with that source tree.  Please see the Makefile here for
comments that explain how to do that.

NOTE: Complete documentation on the pvrusb2 driver is contained in the
html files within the doc directory; these are exactly the same as
what is on the web site at the time.  Please browse those files before
asking questions.
