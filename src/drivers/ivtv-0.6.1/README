This is the README for the ivtv module suite.

---------------- NOTES -----------------
NOTE 1: The ivtv-0.6.x release is for the 2.6.16 kernel. It does NOT compile with
older kernels. If you want to use ivtv on older kernels, then you should use
ivtv-0.4.X instead. The ivtv-0.4 series provides support for kernels up to
2.6.15 only. This 0.6 release is guaranteed NOT to work with kernels >= 2.6.17,
look at www.ivtvdriver.org for more information by the time such kernels appear.

NOTE 2: The initial release of FC5 contains what seems to be a 2.6.15 kernel,
but in reality it is a 2.6.16-rc6 kernel. This driver has support for this
special case.

NOTE 3: The names of the inputs have changed to correspond with the names
as are used by the video4linux subsystem. This means that MythTV users have
to setup their inputs again. In particular 'Tuner 0' is now 'Tuner 1'.

NOTE 4: Two 2.6.16 kernel patches are made available in the misc directory:
samsung.diff fixes the Samsung tuner frequency bands. This patch is expected to
be included in 2.6.16.1. The cx25840.diff fixes a saturation problem and a
NTSC->PAL switch ghosting bug. This fix will be in the 2.6.17 kernel. You can
also use the latest bleeding edge version. For more information:

---------------- NOTES -----------------


The primary goal of the IVTV project is to provide a "clean room" Linux 
Open Source driver implementation for video capture cards based on the 
iCompression iTVC15 or Conexant CX23415/CX23416 MPEG Codec.

The following cards are supported:

Hauppauge WinTV PVR-250
Hauppauge WinTV PVR-350
Hauppauge WinTV PVR-150
Hauppauge WinTV PVR-500
AVerMedia M179
Yuan MPG600/Kuroutoshikou iTVC16-STVLP
Yuan MPG160/Kuroutoshikou iTVC15-STVLP
Yuan PG600/DiamondMM PVR-550 (CX Falcon 2)
Adaptec AVC-2410
Adaptec AVC-2010
Nagase Transgear 5000TV
AOpen VA2000MAX-STN6
Yuan MPG600GR/Kuroutoshikou CX23416GYC-STVLP
Gotview PCI DVD2 Deluxe
Yuan MPC622

Not yet supported (but support is expected in the 2.6.17 kernel):
I/O Data GV-MVP/RX
I/O Data GV-MVP/RX2E
Gotview PCI DVD

The Hauppauge cable set that you can buy for their cards to add an additional
Composite/S-Video input is also supported.

Features:
 * Hardware mpeg2 capture of broadcast video (and sound) via the tuner or
   S-Video/Composite and audio line-in.
 * Hardware mpeg2 capture of FM radio where hardware support exists
 * Supports NTSC, PAL, SECAM with stereo sound
 * Supports SAP and bilingual transmissions.
 * Supports raw VBI (closed captions and teletext).
 * Supports raw YUV and PCM input.

Additional features for the PVR-350 (CX23415 based):
 * Provides hardware mpeg2 playback
 * Provides comprehensive OSD (On Screen Display: ie. graphics overlaying the
   video signal)
 * Provides a framebuffer (allowing X applications to appear on the video
   device)
 * Supports raw YUV output.

Note: the old sourceforge ivtv project is no longer active and will
redirect to ivtvdriver.org. All development now takes place in the
subversion repository on ivtvdriver.org.
