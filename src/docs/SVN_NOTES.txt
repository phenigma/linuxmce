== Svn default properties ==

End-Of-Line delimiter have different sequences in Linux and Windows.
When "svn ci" or "svn up" commands are used, the source file on disk
will be exactly the same for both platforms.
This will break the svn-merge algorithm, and will cause unwanted conflicts.

In order to get rid of these conflicts, the svn:eol-style property should be
set to "native" for all source/text files.
This can be done automatically by svn, if its configuration is correct.

In /pluto/trunk/src/docs/svn_config_dir/ there is a sample configuration for subversion.
It was copied from debian-stable

Only the "config" file was modified, to activate automatic change of properties.
"servers" file does not need to be changed right now

== Changing SVN configuration ==
    <your-src-base-directory> contains your copy of /pluto/trunk/src/

==Linux steps==

Eventually, make a backup of directory ~/.subversion/

Use the following commands
    <your-src-base-directory> contains your copy of /pluto/trunk/src/

    cd <your-src-base-directory>
    cp -av docs/svn_config_dir/config ~/.subversion/

==Windows steps==
(Only for Tortoise-SVN, for now)

    Right click in Explorer on <your-src-base-directory>
    TortoiseSVN -> Settings ... // a dialog will appear

    in the left tree -> General
    on the right -> Subversion configuration file: "Edit" button
    click on "Edit" button // configuration will be opened in Notepad

    Eventually, File-> Save As -> config.orig
    AND close
    AND press "Edit" button again

    open with ANOTHER Notepad <your-src-base-directory>\docs\svn_config_dir\config
    select all text
    copy in clipboard
    close the new notepad

    ALT-TAB to "config-notepad" // opened by the "Edit" button
    select all text and delete it
    paste from clipboard
    save
    close

    press "OK" button to close the TortoiseSVN configuration dialog

    done

== Additional notes ==

    After these steps were performed, do a "svn update".
Solve the conflicts that may appear because you already have files on disk without
svn:eol-style property correctly set.

    Continue your work.
After this point in time, there should be no more EOL conflicts caused by your svn.

Every time you add a new file to svn, the property will be set according to the rules
specified svn "config".
