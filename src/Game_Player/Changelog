	* Fix crash caused by CMD_Stop_Media being called (due to pending message) when Game Player
	  restarts

	* Implement CMD_Pause_Media, CMD_Restart_Media, and initial CMD_Change_Playback_Speed
	  in Game Player, and associated models and controllers for MAME.

	* Clean up spurious logging messages for parts that I know works (demoting them from 
	  LV_CRITICAL, to LV_WARNING or LV_STATUS

	* Remove spurious check for App Server in EmulatorController, as the relevant function
	  is now being called inside Game_Player
