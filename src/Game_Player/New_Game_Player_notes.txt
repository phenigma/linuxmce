EmulatorState - Model object that all emulations inherit from
EmulatorController - Controller object that all emulations inherit from

EmulatorControllerFactory - Returns EmulatorControllers

EmulatorControllers grab an EmulatorState as part of their constructor/setup

EmulatorState contains any data an emulatorcontroller may need to do its job.

EmulatorController is passed the Game_Player instance so it may control and get device data appropriately.
