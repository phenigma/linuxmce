/** @namespace DCE
The Data Commands and Events (DCE) namespace.

The "Generic Serial Device" module (GSD) is designed for the thousands
of devices that are controlled over RS232 and Ethernet.
It allows a LinuxMCE driver to be added using a point-and-click,
fill-in-the-blanks interface.
Basic protocols can be implemented with no programming at all.

For more complicated tasks GSD embeds the Ruby language.
Ruby is a high-level interpreted language with flexible string handling,
like Perl, but the syntax is simpler.
The protocol and embedded Ruby for GSD devices is stored in the database
and automatically synchronized with all other LinuxMCE systems as long
as you leave checked the "Share my IR codes and GSD device" box on
the A/V Equipment wizard.
So there's no compiling and no code to check in.

GSD devices that control a/v equipment, lighting, etc., can be done
in as little as an hour or two, almost never more than a day for
complex protocols.
