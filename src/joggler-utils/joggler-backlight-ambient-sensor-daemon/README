Synopsis:
	joggler-backlight-ambient-sensor-daemon is a daemon that listens to
	the ambient light sensor present on an OpenPeak OpenFrame based
	device (such as the O2 Joggler), and alters the backlight, based on
	the amount of ambient light present in the room, brightening the
	display as more ambient light is present; darkening the display 
	when ambient light decreases in a room.

To run:
	The program runs as a daemon, simply run the program, e.g. as 
	part of an init script, or in rc-local, or as part of a X
	session script, the daemon will detach from the parent
	appropriately.

TODO:
	* Make backlight values NOT hard coded; more intelligent.
