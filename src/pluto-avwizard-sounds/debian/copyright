AC3 and DTS sample files were downloaded from here:

MP3 file was downloaded from here (.net label):
http://gateway.darkera.com/
http://cwarrior.darkera.ca/mp3/GWQUESTIONMARK/D.%20semicolinquestionmark%20-%20loss%20of%20all%20motor%20skills.mp3

To the best of my knowledge all three files are public domain orchestras composed several hundred years ago.
The original files were collected by Radu Cristescu <radu.c@plutohome.com> for testing that speakers are
properly attached to the system.
