This code is deprecated. It has been replaced by src/Activate_Orbiter, 
and is kept here for archival purposes.

Please do not use or maintain this code. It is placed here as an 
example of how to merge a DCE device with a UI toolkit for making 
a DCE device with a GUI control. 

The code was abandoned essentially because it was trying to register
as the same PK_Device as the launch manager. As a result the 
Launch Manager was extended with the necessary functionality to easily
activate the attached orbiter, and a new Activate Orbiter plasmoid 
was written to simply send a message to the launch manager (which
registers using the same PK_Device as specified in /etc/pluto.conf.),
this is much easier as it does not require (1) a linkage to the DCE
libraries, (2) access to the database, as we can simply call 
MessageSend to do the dirty work.
