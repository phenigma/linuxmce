This document is intended to serve as a guide to setting up a Raspberry Pi to function as a Media Director with linuxMCE

==Hardware==
As per current linuxMCE documentation at http://wiki.linuxmce.org/index.php/RaspberryPi
Your core must be LinuxMCE 1204 or higher.
The recommended device is the RPiB 2 or 3. The RPiB 2 runs at a reasonable speed and can support most functions of a LinuxMCE MediaDirector. The RPiB 3 runs about 50% faster in tests than the RPiB 2.
The following Raspbian based SD cards are bootable on anything that is a Raspberry Pi Model B or higher. RPiB 1 performance is very, very, very slow.

==Setup==
This section is intended to outline the steps needed for setting up your linuxmce installation.

=On the Core=
You will need to do these things BEFORE you run the raspberry pi for the first time to make this as smooth as possible.

*Create qMD device on  your core manually.
*Set the MAC address manually. This does mean you will need the mac address somehow before booting it to see the mac address...
**How?
*Run the two following scripts, in this order on your core.
** /usr/pluto/bin/Diskless_Setup.sh
** /usr/pluto/bin/Disked_Setup.sh

Proceed to the raspberry pi setup portion.

=Raspberry Pi Image=
You can find the link to the latest image here: http://wiki.linuxmce.org/index.php/RaspberryPi#Setup_Steps

*DL the image
*Untar the image
*Utilize the dd instructions on Raspberry pi
