	*
	* A Media Plugin is derived from the MediaHandlerBase abstract class.  When it registers, it passes in a MediaHandlerInfo pointer
	* indicating what type of media it can play.  It may register several times with different types of media and different capabilities.
	* So there exists 1 MediaHandlerInfo for each combination of MediaPlugin and MediaType (ie: xine/audio, xine/video, myth/tv, etc.)

		* This will perform some standard tasks commonly needed to setup a plug-in.  First, if PK_DeviceTemplate is specified,

		* it will add the ones from the database.
		* It assigns all the default values for bUsesRemovableMedia, m_bCanStoreOnServer, m_bCanBroadcastInHouse, m_bIsExternalTransmission.
		* If the plug-in isn't associated with any entertainment areas, it will add itself to all entertainment areas where it's devices
		* are located.  Then it registers
		* The calling plug-in can change values after the fact if it deviates from the defaults (ie doesn't support something, or uses different
		* file extensions)
		* If the plug-in wants to change the the entertainment areas, it should set bDontRegister to true, change these values, then register.
		* At registration the media handler associates all the plug-ins with their media types.  Broadcast formats can be set after registration.
