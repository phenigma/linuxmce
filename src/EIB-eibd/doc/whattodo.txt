ok, what is to be done now:

there should be some ways to autfill Telegrams from values.
there are 15 standardised datataypes that can be used. on, off are standardised dtp. but that may need another class..

then, it would be easier to create the Telegramm: translate Message to value, operate on value, fill Telegram with value and required datapoint. then you just need to tell the "knxDevice" to fill datagram groupaddress with the good one..
