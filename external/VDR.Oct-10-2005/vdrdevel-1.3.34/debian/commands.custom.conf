# This is an example file for defining external commands, that will be 
# accessable via VDR's OSD menu.
# The commands will be executed under the same user id that vdr is running 
# with, so take care if your are running vdr as root!
# 
# The format of a command entry is:  <title> : <command>
# <title> is the menu text shown on the OSD and <command> is the command to
# be executed. Everything that <command> writes to stdout will be displayed
# on the OSD. i.e.:
#
# Open fortune cookie: /usr/games/fortune
#
# If you uncomment the line above and restart vdr, you will have a new 
# command menu entry, called "Open fortune cookie", that will show you a 
# random epigram. ( you may need an "apt-get install fortune" first! )
#
# If you are using the reccmd-patch, you can even divide your commands into
# submenus. To do so, preceed all sub menu items with a "-". i.e.:
# 
# Fortune Cookies ... : echo "sub menu, no command"
# -Long Dictum        : /usr/games/fortune -l
# -Short Apothegms    : /usr/games/fortune -s
# -Special Topics ... : echo "sub-sub menu, no command"
# --Literature        : /usr/games/fortune literature
# --Riddles           : /usr/games/fortune riddles
#
# Again, just uncomment the above lines and restart vdr to see for your self,
# how this looks like on the OSD.
