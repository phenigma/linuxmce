.SH NAME
runvdr
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B runvdr
is called by the init-script of vdr. It acts as a watchdog for vdr and will 
reload the dvb-modules and vdr, if vdr exits with an exitcode different from 0.

.B runvdr
will call /usr/bin/vdr and will pass all Commandline-options directly to 
/usr/bin/vdr.

.B runvdr
needs to be called by root in order to work correct, because it will try to 
unload/load kernel-modules!
