Description: is a skin-Plugin for vdr >= 1.3.18

skinelchi is a combination of skin and plugin, some options are not availyble at
"setup"->"osd", some only available at "setup"->"plugins"->"skinelchi".

Building:
    There are some options in MAKEFILE:
    
    1. HAVE_C295 = 1 #if you use c++2.95 and get error "redefinition of 'template <class T> void swap(_Tp &, _Tp &)'"
     - please tell me, if you know a better solution
    2. HAVE_IMAGEMAGICK = 1 # uncomment this, if you have ImageMagick and want see pictures from epg4vdr
     - to support pictures from epg4vdr
     - you must also select the option in "setup"->"plugins"->"skinelchi"
     - you can select between 120x90 (original) - i think it is too little -
       and 180x144 - here can you also select the algorithm for resize
    3. HAVE_YAEPG_PATCH = 1 # only experimentell - uncomment this, if vdr patched with YAEPG-PATCH and you want see video-window in menu
    4. VIDEOSTATUS = 1 # only experimentell - uncomment this, if you want some infos of videostatus in DisplayChannel and DisplayReplay
    5. DEBUG = 1 # only for threads in DisplayMenu.c for screenshot-display of video-window and for epg4vdr
    
    - uncomment the needed options.

Commandline-Option:
  -c DIR  --icache=DIR cache converted images in DIR\n"
                       (default: '/video/epgimages')\n"
                       (if use only show setting in setup)\n";

Setup:
    - several options - i think they are self-descripted
    - on color-changing be careful - maybe some areas defined more colors as
      the osd-areas included - can be, must define some equal colors


      
Problems:
    - on unmodified DVB-Cards maybe the OSD is become unusable, if you use
      videowindow - note: is only experimentell
      -> only a reload of drivers helpes
    - videowindow is freezed sometimes - note: is only experimentell
      -> change channel to another or the same helpes
    - Only color-changing is stored in setup if you call setup from main-menu
      and leave setup with <OK>
      (but the changes works until next restart)
      -> the other setup options will be only stored, if you
      you call "setup"->"plugins"->"skinelchi" and leave it with <OK>
    - someone (on vdr-wiki) reported restarts with c++ 2.95 and version 0.0.1h
      with option HAVE_IMAGEMAGICK= 1 and vdr 1.3.23, when he call
      "setup"->"plugins"->"skinelchi"
      - i can't fix it, because i have a problem with ImageMagick/vdr and
        c++ 2.95
        (with gcc3.0 this works on my system)
    
FAQ: Q: Why I have a blank entry in main menu? (vdr-wiki)
     A: You have select the setup-option "Show in main menu", but you have
        delete the default entry under "Main menu entry"
	-> must define a name

     Q: I have select "Show epg4vdr-picture", but no picture is show. Why?
	(vdrportal.de)
     A: To show pictures another defined osd must used.
        If you uses a unmodified DVB-card, maybe thats not possible to create
	the needed areas, then you must define osd in "setup"->"osd" a little
	smaller, because a 4-bit-area needs more memory as a 2-bit-area.
	Maybe I changed this in future, that only epg-info-window will be
	smaller.
