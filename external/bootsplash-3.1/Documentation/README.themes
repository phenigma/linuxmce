   Themeing

   It's possible to create different [10]themes for the bootsplash
   screen. This makes it easier to exchange the pictures and animations
   shown during bootup. The current theme is selected by the THEME
   variable in /etc/sysconfig/bootsplash. 
   If you change the theme you have to call "mkinitrd" and, if using 
   lilo as bootloader, "lilo" afterwards. Bootsplash themes are by default
   stored in /etc/bootsplash/themes.

   Each theme has its own directory with several subdirectories:

   images/
   contains jpeg pictures for the current splash theme. It's suggested
   that each picture should have a text area of at least 80x25 so all
   boot messages can be seen properly. If you create a theme with the
   text window residing at a different position than the default one, you
   need to change this in the configuration files. See configuration
   files in config/. If you change a picture here, you need to call
   mkinitrd to notify the kernel about the new picture.

   config/
   contains config files for the different jpeg pictures (defining text
   area and such) as well as the bootup animation config file
   (animations.cfg) If you change the bootsplash picture configuration,
   you need to call mkinitrd to notify the kernel about your changes.
   This is not needed if you change the animation configuration in
   animation.cfg

   animations/
   contains the status animations that are shown during bootup. see
   config/ for configuration file. The animations are stored in the
   portable and free MNG format, the animated companion of the PNG file
   format. You can easily create animations from a PNG or JPG picture
   series using "convert" from the ImageMagick package.

   Example: convert -delay 20 anim*.png anim.mng

   bootloader/
   "message" file for bootloader (i.e. lilo/grub).

   In version 3 almost everything is themeable, and yes, almost
   everything is defined in the configuration files. Because the format
   of the configuration files is somewhat obtuse you'll need to read the
   information in the file README.config.
