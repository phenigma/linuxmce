\fBincludeprog\fP \- dummy script

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the \fBincludeprog\fP script.
.PP
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution to describe
how to get the includeprog configuration variable from bootsplash 3.1
working with the Debian distribution.
.PP 
\fBincludeprog\fP is just an dummy script which does exactly nothing.
If you don't have it, \fBsplash.sh\fP complains that includeprog could not
be found, cause it includes the config without any parsing. With this
script, splash.sh works without spamming your console with file not
found messages.
