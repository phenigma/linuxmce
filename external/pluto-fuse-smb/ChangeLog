	* Took Vincent Wagelaar's fusesmb code and stripped the network
	neighbourhood functionality. The new program can be used to mount samba
	shares just like cifs, but with fuse instead of the cifs kernel module.
	* Removed hashing code
	* Removed network scanner code
	* Added check before going into fuse to see if mount succeeded
