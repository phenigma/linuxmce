.TH ZLESS 1
.SH NAME
zless \- file perusal filter for crt viewing of compressed text
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zless
[ name ...  ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I  Zless
is a filter which allows examination of compressed or plain text files
one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  It is the equivalent of
setting the environment variable LESSOPEN to "|gzip -cdfq %s",
and then running
.IR less .
However, enough people seem to think that having the
command 
.I zless
available is important to be worth providing it.

Note that zless does not work with files piped to it on stdin, it only works
with files specified as arguments.  If you really want to use less in a pipe,
then do the uncompress explicitly and pipe to less instead of zless.
