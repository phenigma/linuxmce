This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of System V Init.  Init
was written by Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>.

This package was put together by Bruce Perens <Bruce@Pixar.com> from pre-
distribution sources. Ian Murdock <imurdock@debian.org> integrated it into
the base system maintained it until the end of 1995. Miquel van Smoorenburg
<miquels@cistron.nl> has integrated debian support into the base package.

Since version 2.80, debian support was taken out of the upstream package
and is now only present in the Debian prepackaged version. This was in
preparance for the split into seperate packages (sysvinit, sysv-rc,
initscripts) which has been realized in version 2.85.

The upstream source is available at:
