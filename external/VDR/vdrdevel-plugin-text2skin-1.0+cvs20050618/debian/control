Description: Plugin to vdr that loads and views skins
 This plugin is designed to load and interpret a set of files describing the
 layout of the On Screen Display and to make this "Skin" available to VDR via
 Setup -> OSD in the main menu. Of course it is possible to load more than
 one text-based skin this way and to choose between them while running VDR. All
 skins may be themeable (you can create your own color-theme) and translateable
 as the author of the skin wishes.
