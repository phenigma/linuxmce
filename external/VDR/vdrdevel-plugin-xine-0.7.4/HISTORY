VDR Plugin 'xine' Revision History
----------------------------------

2005-05-08: Version 0.7.4

- Fixed compilation issue with gcc-4.1 (thanks to ollo at vdr-portal for
  reporting this issue).
- Fixed audio output when used with muggle (thanks to Der_Olli at
  vdr-portal for testing).
- Fixed input_vdr for proper "C" coding (thanks to Philip Lawatsch for
  reporting this issue).
- Increased xine-lib's demux_mpeg_pes.c's WRAP_THRESHOLD to 270000 to
  fix detection of false discontinuities (thanks to Jouni Karvo for 
  reporting this issue).
- Fixed xine-lib's xxmc decoder to properly decode radio-plugin's 
  background images.
- Updated dvbplayer patch for VDR-1.3.24.

2005-04-11: Version 0.7.3

- Started detection of AFD header in xine to automatically crop out the
  interesting part of the image later.
- Adopted implementation of cXineDevice::SetDigitialAudioDevice() to
  different calling order in VDR 1.3.23.
- Improved cXineDevice::SetDigitalAudioDevice() when replaying recordings.
- Added setup option to automatically make vdr-xine the primary device
  while xine is connected to vdr-xine (requested by Der_Olli at vdr-portal).
- Added setup option to consider all semi transparent colors as opaque to
  make the menu more readable.
- Added commandline option '-s' to switch to skin 'curses' while xine is
  not connected to vdr-xine (requested by Rantanen Teemu).
- Added commandline option '-q' to suppress debug messages (useful in
  combination with option '-s').
- Moved disconnect to cXineDevice::Stop() to get the new options to work.
- Fixed all (?) deadlock situations in RPC command processing (e. g.
  stopping replay while switching a channel).
- Fixed deadlocks in vdr-xine's xread(). A possible drawback is that now
  a disconnect might happen in such a case.
- Fixed VDR's I-frame processing which caused disconnects e. g. while
  moving cut marks in HDTV recordings. vdr-1.2.23-dvbplayer3.patch is 
  highly recommended for proper operation of vdr-xine.
- Improved cXineDevice::StillImage() implementation to immediate display
  the frame (improves moving cut marks).
- Fixed cXineDevice::StillImage() to work properly in combination with
  the plugin vdr-radio.
  BUG: xine's driver xxmc shows just a black screen on my EPIA MII-6000E.
- Reintroduced usleeps() in input_vdr.c for flush, OSD flush and reset
  audio. sched_yield() simply caused to much CPU load while waiting 
  about 40 ms to reach the expected state. Improves number of dropped 
  frames when switching channels.
- Optimized OSD display: VDR's channel display repeatedly sends a dirty
  OSD which doesn't differ from the previous one. Improves number of
  dropped frames while switching channel.
  BUG: it's still unclear whether this causes some OSD artefacts.
- Fixed demux_mpeg_pes' discontinuity detection. Previously, when a PTS
  wrap happend, xine stopped replay for about 26.5 hours.
- vdr-xine now nolonger set's xine's metronom directly but tells it's
  demuxer to do the job. Improves switching channels.
- Optimized implementation of cXineDevice::Clear() in input_vdr.c.
  BUG: it may happen that xine's audio driver ALSA might get into a state
  of "silence" where it doesn't recover from until you stop replaying the
  recording. I still didn't find a way to reproduce this but it has to do
  with trickspeed, pause, play, and probably cut marks.
- Fixed post_vdr.c to detect MRL changes for discovering streams sent from
  VDR, e. g. when xine is not started with the MRL specified on it's 
  command line.
  BUG: It's possible that xine crashes due to this detection. xine doesn't
  allocate a different stream for a different MRL, but maybe other players
  do. I'm not sure whether I managed to increase the streams usage counter
  properly (by allocating an event queue) until I detect the new stream
  respectively MRL.
  BUG: post_vdr doesn't operate when xine's driver xxmc is used due to some
  limitation/incomplete implementation in xine's plugin interface.
- Fixed xine's deinterlacer interface to take care of cropping. Previously
  the OSD was resizing like mad e. g. between 1920x1080 and 1920x1088.
- Added support for VDR's new AUDIO key in xine (thanks to Darren Salt for
  reporting this issue).

2005-02-27: Version 0.7.2

- Fixed cXineDevice::StillPicture() to support three times larger still
  image data than before. This was necessary to properly support mp3
  plugin's cover image feature (thanks to burki at vdr-portal for reporting
  this issue).
- Removed cXineStatus as vdr-xine now uses a different method of detecting
  LiveTV. This one works better in combination with mp3 plugin (thanks to
  Klaus Schmidinger for suggesting the new solution).
- Updated xine-lib patch for current CVS (thanks to Grégoire Favre for
  reporting this issue).

2005-02-13: Version 0.7.1

- Updated finish translation (thanks to Rolf Ahrensberg for supplying the
  update).
- Fixed a typo in checking for VDR versions before 1.3.18. This broke
  successful compilation for versions between 1.3.8 and 1.3.18 (thanks to
  Andreas Urban for reporting this issue).
- Fixed processing of cDevice::SetDigitalAudio() as it skipped displaying
  of NO SIGNAL when switching channels.

2005-01-29: Version 0.7.0

- Implemented centre-cut-out mode: this feature will crop away the black bars
  around a 4:3 image which is broadcast in a 16:9 stream and is displayed on
  a 4:3 monitor. See MANUAL how to enable this mode.
- Fixed OSD scaling for the case where xine cropped the image for displaying.
- Integrated patch for image grabbing. You can now specify the absolute path
  of the utilities for grabbing an image. Furthermore, the patch fixes a
  possible security issue when the filename for the GRAB command contained
  special shell characters (thanks to Darren Salt for supplying the patch).
- Image grabbing now also requires pnmcut to support cropped images.
- Prepended VDR_XINE_ to Makefile variables FIFO_DIR and SET_VIDEO_WINDOW to
  avoid collisions when vdr-xine's variables are set in VDR's Make.conf.
- Added syslog messages when VDR_XINE_FIFO_DIR or any fifo cannot be created.
- Added a further config option to vdr-xine's setup menu: you may now specify
  how VDR's mute requests will be processed in xine:
  a) ignore
  b) simulate (set volume to 0 / restore volume)  
  c) execute
- Fixed xine part to update UI when volume / muting is changed.
- Updated INSTALL, MANUAL and xineI18n.h accordingly.

2005-01-23: Version 0.6.5

- Adapted vdr-xine to the recent changes in VDR-1.3.19.
- With VDR-1.3.19, the HDTV patch for VDR is obsolete now. See the file
  vdr-patches-README.txt on my homepage for details.

2005-01-10: Version 0.6.4

- Adapted vdr-xine to the recent changes in VDR-1.3.18. The xine part has also
  changed and therefore a rebuild of xine is required.
- With VDR-1.3.18 a lot of my patches for VDR are obsolete now. See the file
  vdr-patches-README.txt on my homepage for details.
- Removed the necessity of changing POLLTIMEOUTS_BEFORE_DEVICECLEAR.
- Updated INSTALL appropriately.

2004-12-31: Version 0.6.3

- Fixed uninitialized variable in xineRemote.c. Release 0.6.2 showed high CPU
  load of XineRemote control thread when switching between channels with
  different resolution.

2004-12-30: Version 0.6.2

- Integrated i18n updates (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg for supplying the patch).
- Fixed processing of MPEG1 streams. vdr-xine should now be able to work
  together with vdr-analogtv.
- Fixed race-condition at shutdown when at client-disconnect vdr-xine accessed
  the already destructed xineRemote.
- Fixed invalid pointer access in input_vdr.c (thanks to Darren Salt for
  supplying the patch).
- Fixed some OSD update issues that happend when xine asked for an update and
  VDR was drawing on the OSD at the same time.
- Prepared xine part for integration into xine-lib-1.0.x.
- Synced SPU processing. DVD subtitles should now nolonger be several seconds
  ahead of their expected presentation time.
- Updated MANUAL to reflect name changes in xine's config file.

2004-12-10: Version 0.6.1

- Added vdr-xine option "-i NUM" which can be used to get two or more vdr-xine
  instances running on the same machine (in different VDR instances). The same
  option is available as "--vdr-instance=NUM" to xineplayer but there it must
  be the first argument to not conflict with any other options from mplayer.
- Fixed cXineDevice::StillPicture() to automatically add an PES video header
  if the given data doesn't contain one. As a result vdr-streamdev-* is now
  able to show an image while pausing Live-TV (thanks to Darren Salt for some
  hints on optimized coding).
- Fixed some special cases of dolby audio processing introduced in 0.5.3 
  (thanks to Markus Maierhofer for reporting this issue).
- Moved option OSD_SCALING_MODE and DONT_CHANGE_XINE_VOLUME from Makefile to
  vdr-xine's setup. Therefore the same binary package can now be run on less
  powerful machines too.
- Integrated a large piece of xine-lib.patch into xine-lib-cvs. As a result
  the configure option --disable-exact-blending is gone and is now available
  as runtime configureable option "video.disable_exact_osd_alpha_blending".
- Updated xineI18n.h. Feel free to supply updates for other languages too.
- Updated INSTALL and MANUAL accordingly.
- Introduced xineCommon.h to handle poisend VDR source.
- Prepared xineI18n.h for additional languages.
- Added a setup option for adjusting OSD gamma correction when OSD scaling
  is necessary.
- Fixed xine part to no longer freeze when one connects to stale vdr-xine
  FIFOs.
- Fixed xine part to immediately react on the "stop" button in case where
  VDR doesn't send a stream to xine.
- The error message about missing noSignal.pes is now also logged via syslog
  as there was otherwise no indicater found in the logfile why VDR terminated
  that early. 

2004-11-02: Version 0.6.0

- Implemented playback of external sources. This is done using the well known
  mplayer plugin in combination with my mplayer wrapper called "xineplayer".
  Just setup mplayer plugin as it's documentation states. Then edit it's
  "mplayer.sh" and replace "mplayer" by "xineplayer". xineplayer get's built
  into vdr-xine's source directory. You'll have to copy it to a "bin"
  directory which is part of your PATH or you might want to specifiy it's full
  path in mplayer.sh. For this first release you'll have to select mplayer
  plugin's "TRADITIONAL" mode to get it working with vdr-xine.
- Exact but CPU intensive OSD blending can now be disabled in xine-lib by
  giving the configure switch "--disable-exact-blending" to "./autogen.sh".
- Fixed high CPU load of vdr-xine when xine was disconnected while a currently
  replayed recording was paused.
- Removed DATA_DIR. "noSignal.pes" is now expected below VDR's config files
  directory, i. e. .../plugins/xine/noSignal.pes.
- Added OSD scaling mode "auto SHQ" which automatically chooses SHQ mode for
  low resolution streams (width < 360 respectively height < 288). This mode is
  now the one which is preselected in Makefile.
- Updated INSTALL and MANUAL accordingly.

2004-10-24: Version 0.5.3

*** NO NEED TO RECOMPILE xine-lib / xine-ui THIS TIME ***

- Fixed dolby audio processing to get recordings (and former live stream) of
  channel "ProSiebenHD" to play properly.
- Fixed extraction of PTS values (ignore PTS of value 0) resulting in better
  prebuffering (thanks to Cristiano Bozzi for reporting this issue).
- Changed data processing to comply with VDR's new buffer handling since 
  release 1.3.13 (thanks to Klaus Schmidinger for assistance).
- Scrambled flag on PES packets is now cleared to not have xine terminate 
  playback due to bad reception quality respectively early data transmission
  while device is still tuneing (thanks to mvdbeek at vdr-portal for reporting
  this issue).
- Replaced all usleep() calls by cMutex / cCondVar substitutes.
- Added paragraph to INSTALL (BUILDING XINE) about required versions of
  autoconf suite for building xine (requested by Frank99 at vdr-portal).

2004-10-09: Version 0.5.2

- Fixed xine-lib/src/vdr/input_vdr.c for compliance with C coding. It should
  now compile properly with gcc-2.95.3 (thanks to Jouni Karvo for reporting
  this issue).
- Implemented cPlugin::CommandLineHelp() (suggested by ronnykornexl at
  vdr-portal).
- Updated INSTALL and pointed to xine-cvs archives on my homepage.
- Updated INSTALL and documented "ERROR: remote control XineRemote not ready!"
  which appears in VDR's logfile.
- Updated INSTALL and mentioned delay of about 10 seconds until VDR enters
  "Phase 2" of remote learning mode after pressing a remote key in "Phase 1".
- Fixed compile error of xine-lib's video_out_xvmc.c which was caused by my
  OSD patches (thanks to Kron at vdr-portal for reporting this issue).
- Fixed a buffer overrun in my patches to xine-lib which caused xine to die
  occasionally when VDR's OSD was active and/or operated (thanks to Joerg
  Knitter for intensively testing vdr-xine).
- Tried to create a patch for xine-lib that complains when applied to RC6 but
  all rejects should only address the newly added driver xxmc. Therefore they
  can simply be ignored.
- Currently, xine-ui.patch is empty but I didn't want to remove this file as
  doing so might break some people's build scripts.

2004-10-04: Version 0.5.1

- Updated documentation (thanks to Darren Salt for supplying the patch).
- OSD scaling is now using frame resolution instead of stream resolution. This
  should make the OSD show up more often already at the right resoltion. For
  almost immediate response to resolution changes it is required to run xine
  with --post vdr.
- Completed implementation of cDevice::GrabImage() method. It now supports
  xine's different image formats and honors the different aspect ratio of
  16:9 broadcasts.
- Added paragraph to INSTALL about additional programs which are needed to
  successfully grab images.
- Added paragraph to INSTALL about remote learning mode.
- Synchronized OSD output. Hideing an OSD and grabing an image immediately
  afterwards leaded to a snapshot which still showed the OSD.
- Probably fixed audio replay on channels with still video. Prebuffer time is
  now extended dynamically by the difference between audio and video time 
  stamps on the channel in question.
- Fixed prebuffering after toggleing audio channel.
- Reorganized directory structure of the xine part once again. xine-ui now
  needs the configure switch "--enable-vdr-keys" to support vdr-xine's remote.
- Improved OSD scaling which took over month to optimize. See Makefile for
  OSD_SCALING_HQ. One might also choose OSD_SCALING_SHQ but be warned about
  the CPU load it causes.
- xine-lib-1-RC6 should be sufficient for this release but my patches will
  complain about the recently added driver xxmc.

2004-08-08: Version 0.5.0

- Added paragraph to INSTALL about using the correct xine-config in Makefile
  (suggested by Luca Olivetti).
- Fixed SEGV (in remote control code) which happend when VDR was exiting
  (thanks to Mattias Grönlund for supplying the patch).
- Added a Makefile switch DONT_CHANGE_XINE_VOLUME to have vdr-xine never
  change xine's volume control (e. g. when connecting xine to VDR), as this
  might lead to (un)muting the wrong audio channels (requested by Jouni
  Karvo).
- Fixed quickly switching between play / pause. There is still a lockup left
  to be fixed that appears on some machines when jumping between cutting marks
  (thanks to peter_weber69 at vdr-portal for testing the fix).
- Added video scaling by xine post plugin 'vdr' to support yaepg plugin. One
  will have to add "--post vdr" to the command line or select the post plugin
  via the user interface. As yaepg patches VDR, you'll have to tell vdr-xine
  whether you want to support yaepg by enabling SET_VIDEO_WINDOW in Makefile.
- Looking forward to having the xine part integrated into CVS, the locations
  of my plugins in xine-lib's source tree have changed. INSTALL was updated
  to the new patch procedure. A current CVS source tree is required (can be
  found on my home page, too).

2004-07-25: Version 0.4.3

- Fixed xineI18n.h for compatibility with VDR-1.3.[01]. The Russian translation
  entries were introduced with VDR-1.3.2 (reported by Rolf Ahrensberg).
- Implemented OSD scaling. Currently, the scaled OSD is of "bad" quality, but
  as a start, it's better than nothing :-)
- Tried to fix the issues which were recently introduced by soft-start, but
  it's likely that the fixes still don't work for less powerful machines. In
  such a case, locate softStartCalcSpeed() in xineDevice.c and try differnt
  methods (0..3). Please drop me a line on success respectively failure.

2004-07-04: Version 0.4.2

- Integrated swedish translation supplied by Tomas Prybil.
- Fixed xineI18n.h for compatibility with VDR-1.3.6 (thanks to ronnykornexl at
  vdr-portal for reporting this issue).
- Followed http://www.vdr-wiki.de/wiki/index.php/MANUAL-DE#Patches for creating
  respectively naming xine patches (thanks to ronnykornexl at vdr-portal).
- New feature for Live-TV mode: "soft-start" replays the stream in slow motion 
  while buffering. Useful for zapping, where you'll see an image of the current
  program quite early. The stream speed starts now at 50 %, slows down to 25 % 
  and then speeds up to 100 %. This happens within the prebuffer time, so you
  should increase it (e. g. to 50) if you experience problems.

2004-06-27: Version 0.4.1

- Fixed audio handling of the previous release as it broke playing mp3s (thanks
  to Jouni Karvo for reporting this issue).
- Fixed xine's linear PCM decoder to support more sample rates. Previously, mp3
  files did often play to fast.
- DVDs should play properly now, independent of the dolby setting.
- Disabled debug code. Please remove all /tmp/frame* files which might have
  been created by release 0.4.0.
- Integrated remote control patch for fbxine (provided by Dirk Meyer), but I'm
  still waiting for an example on how to bind the keys in fbxine.
- Added a section to MANUAL about xine's command line and useful options 
  (suggested by Jouni Karvo).
- VDR: Improved performance. Please apply the vdr-1.3.11 patches which are 
  available on my homepage.
- VDR: Fixed recording replay when reaching the end of a recording in
  trickspeed mode. VDR switched to play mode instead of ending replay.
  
2004-06-21: Version 0.4.0

- Integrated patch which implements cDevice::GetSPUDecoder() (thanks to Sven
  Goethel for supplying the patch).
- Fixed INSTALL again for correct quoting (thanks to Johannes Schoeller for 
  reporting this issue).
- Updated xineI18n.h for now 18 languages in VDR 1.3.x (thanks to Achim
  Tuffentsammer for the hint).
- Added a paragraph to INSTALL for users of full featured cards (suggested by
  Tuomas Jormola).
- Rewrote INSTALL in various places, to contain much helpful information
  discussed previously on the mailing list.
- Integrated patch for supplying xine the default MRL of VDR (thanks to Darren
  Salt).
- Added cDevice::Flush() to work around xine's large buffers.
- xine-lib-1-rc5 should be sufficient to get the plugin working.
- Improved a lot regarding interoperability with plugin vdr-dvd. To make use 
  of these changes, you'll have to adjust your '.xine/config'. See MANUAL for 
  more information.
- It is recommended to enable dolby when using vdr-dvd.

2004-05-27: Version 0.3.4

- Fixed INSTALL to suggest a correctly quoted 'runvdr' command for running the 
  plugin for the first time (thanks to peter_weber69 and anonymous (aka Ronny) 
  on VDR Portal for pointing this out).
- Fixed xineOsd.c to show OSD in initial remote key learning mode (thanks to 
  chris281080 on VDR Portal for determining this issue).
- Added a warning message to xineLib.c, in the case where 'noSignal.pes' can't
  be opened, e. g. if DATA_DIR is not set correctly in Makefile.
- Fixed Makefile to use the default DATA_DIR, not my personal one.

2004-05-22: Version 0.3.3

- Fixed input_plugin/input_vdr.c to return proper values for cDevice::GetSTC()
  (thanks to Pekka Virtanen for supplying a test plugin).

2004-05-22: Version 0.3.2

- Fixed xineRemote.c to be compatible with API of VDR 1.2.6.

2004-05-21: Version 0.3.1

- Updated xine-lib.patch to support all VDR remote keys.
- Patch file renamed to xine.patch, as xine-ui is modified too.
- Updated INSTALL to reflect new patch file name and patching of xine-ui.
- Updated MANUAL to tell command line args and xine's keybindings.

2004-05-21: Version 0.3.0

- Changed code sequence to follow the C language properly (reported by 
  Jouni Karvo).
- Updated Finnish translation and added empty Russian translations while 
  maintaining compatibility with VDR 1.2.x (reported by Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Dropped (later maybe configurable) sending MUTE to xine, as it's not
  really necessary for normal operation of VDR (requested by Jouni Karvo).
- Fixed sending dolby audio to xine (requires up-to-date xine-lib CVS).
- Added support for VDR-1.3.7's new OSD interface.
- Integrated patch from Simon Truss to send keystrokes from xine to VDR
  for controlling VDR from within xine.
- Enhanced compatibility of xine part to support xine's older API for
  VIA-enhanced xine (thanks to Vincenzo Memeo).

2004-05-05: Version 0.2.2

- Added define _GNU_SOURCE to Makefile (just like for new plugins).
- DATA_DIR in Makefile contained path of my system.
- OSD update in xine is now optimized to VDR's dirty OSD area.
- Implemented cDevice::GetSTC().
- Removed some unnecessary PES packet requirements for trickspeed mode.
- Moved image conversion from xine to VDR for cDevice::GrabImage()
  implementation.
- Added support for dolby audio (i. e. cDevice::PlayAudio(): untested due
  to lack of hardware).
- Added configuration option to enable dolby audio (default: off).
- When xine connects to VDR, volume and muting are adjusted to fit VDR's 
  values.

2004-04-23: Version 0.2.1

- Corrected some FIXMEs for certain recordings.
- Audio is now unmuted when leaving a recording in trickmode speed.

2004-04-22: Version 0.2.0

- Added trickspeed mode.
- Added image grabbing (requires y4mscaler, y4mtoppm and pnmtojpeg).
- Added automatic selection of prebuffer mode.
- Dropped config option 'xine.modeReplay.prebufferFrames'.
- Dropped config option 'xine.usageModeDefault'.
- Dropped main menu entry.
- Partly integrated Makefile patch from Darren Salt.
- Fixed some stuff regarding latest CVS xine.

- Fixed VDR's high CPU load when no xine connected.
- Added Finnish translation supplied by Rolf Ahrenberg.
- Supplied a completely black 'noSignal.pes' to prevent the monitor from
  damage while listening to radio stations for a long time.
