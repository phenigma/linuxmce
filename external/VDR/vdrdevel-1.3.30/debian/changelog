    - Installing channels.conf and examples into config dir in postinst
    - Copying of remote conf files from vdr-1.2.6 in init script
  * Tobias Grimm <tg@e-tobi.net>:
    - moved /usr/bin/vdr-recordingaction to /usr/lib/vdr/vdr-recordingaction
    - moved /usr/bin/shutdownvdr to /usr/lib/vdr/vdr-shutdown
    - default location for recordings according to FHS is now /var/lib/video
    - The vdr config dir is /var/lib/vdr now. Real config files are linked to
      this directory, while generated or vdr-managed config files 
      (like timers.conf) can exist physically in this directory.
    - Shutdown-Hook mechanism taken over from Alioth. Hook scripts are no
      longer  restricted to be shell scripts. (See README.Debian)
    - moved PLUGIN_DIR, PLUGIN_PREFIX, CFG_DIR, PLUGIN_CFG_DIR,
      PLUGIN_ORDER_FILE, CMDHOOKSDIR, REC_CMD and SHUTDOWN_CMD from the
      default file to the init script
    - renamed /usr/bin/ctvdr*.sh to /usr/bin/ctvdr*

    - moved epg2html.pl and svdrpsend.pl to /usr/lib/vdr/
    - Linking var/lib/video to var/lib/video.00. This way, adding
      more partitions is simply a matter of creating video.01, video.02 and
      so on.
    - Added workaround for "Video data stream broken" bug, if you use more
      than one DVB card. Just set VDSB_WORKAROUND=yes in /etc/default/vdr to
      enable it. (szap from package dvb-utils is needed!)
