MTX

Programs:
  mtx is the media changer control program
  tapeinfo dumps some interesting stuff out of tape drives' mode pages and
sense pages. 
  loaderinfo dumps some interesting stuff out of loaders' mode pages and
sense pages.
  scsitape sends raw SCSI commands to tape drives. Do not use this unless
you know exactly what you're doing, because you can easily get into a feud
with the system's own tape driver and end up locking up the whole system.

INSTALLATION:

WARNING: MUST HAVE GNU 'make' TO DO THIS! (e.g. use 'gmake' on freebsd, not
BSD 'make'!).

Type ./configure to create a Makefile. Type 'make', then 'make
install'. Type 'man mtx' for info about mtx, and 'man tapeinfo' for
info about tapeinfo. Enjoy.

My thanks to Doug Bonnell of Breece Hill for suggestions on
dynamically allocating element info, Tien That Ton of Tandberg for
being the original tester of the Import/Export Element stuff, Ken
Porter for RPM's, William D. Smith for the HP/UX port, Kai Makisara
for the barcode backoff fix, and to all the other people out there who
have used it, found problems with it, and let me know about it (you
know who you are).
