Operating Systems:
-----------------

mtx 1.2 is currently known to work flawlessly under the following
operating systems:

Linux (2.2.5 kernel and above)
FreeBSD (tested with versions 3.2 and above, but should work for all 3.x
         and 4.x). 

Various people have reported that they have managed to make mtx work
on various versions of Solaris. Please check the mtx list archives (
http://mtx.sourceforge.net ) to see how they've done it.

IRIX 6.5 apparently works flawlessly:

(Richard.Lefebvre(@AROBAS)cerca(.POINT)umontreal(.POINT)ca):
I just wanted to send you 1 or 2 comments on mtx. I just downloaded it
last friday to use with and SGI Origin2000 and an 8 slot DLT autoloader.
The whole thing compiled fine (under gcc).

From Dan Wright (dtwright at uiuc dot uiuc.edu):
  I just wanted to send an e-mail to let you know that mtx 1.2.9
  works great for me on IRIX 6.5 with an ADIC FastStor DLT8000.
  IRIX 6.5 has a generic scsi interface installed by default, so to
  access the autoloader I use "mtx -f /dev/scsi/sc1d1l0" (bus 1 id 1
  lun 0).

Changer Devices

The following has been directly tested:

* Exabyte 220 with 1 drive   (21 slots)
* Exabyte 220 with 2 drives  (21 slots)
* Exabyte EZ-17  (7 slots)
    Known quirks: Must eject tape using 'mt' or 'tapectl' prior to using
  the 'unload' command.

* Seagate DDS-4 DAT AutoLoader (1 drive, 6 slots)
       Product ID: 'DAT    06241-XXX'  
    Known quirks: Uses LUN 1 for robot. On Linux, must compile kernel with 
    "Scan SCSI LUNs" or add the following line to your /etc/lilo.conf (and
    re-run /sbin/lilo):
         append="max_scsi_luns=2" 

* DISC D-40 optical library (2 drives, 40 slots, 1 import/export): Yes,
  it really does report that it's a Maxoptix!
   Product Type: Medium Changer
   Vendor ID: 'Maxoptix'

The following have been tested by others, and information may be
incomplete or in error even.

* "Lago Sys LS-380L/StorageTek 9704/Imation ITL-2225 (mine's a 
  StorageTek labeled)" 25-slot, 2-drive, 1-arm, 1-import/export
  (eswan at lips dot net)

* HP SureStore Optical 80fx. (mmarchione at nyhomes dot org )
  Vendor: HP       Model: C1160F           Rev: 0.40
  Type:   Medium Changer                   ANSI SCSI revision: 02 

* Breece Hill tape library (unknown configuration, unknown reporter):
  Vendor ID: 'BHTI'
  Product ID: 'Q2 '
   Oddities: Must either turn on auto-inventory, or run 'mtx inventory'
     prior to running any other mtx command. Reads bar codes by yanking
    tapes out of slots and waving them in front of bar code reader, so
    inventory of tapes with no bar code is VERY slow (bar code your tapes!).


* Seagate Scorpion DDS-3 4-tape autochanger 
     (jsled at normandy dot smarttouch dot com):
         Vendor ID: 'ARCHIVE '
         Product ID: 'Python 04377-XXX'

* Overland 15 tape 1 drive DLT changer: (asmith at umdgrb dot umd dot edu)
   Vendor ID: 'OVERLAND'
   Product ID: 'LXB             '

* ADIC DAT AutoChanger -- 1 drive, 12 slots, 1 import-export:
      Vendor ID: 'ADIC    '   (andrew_gray at irobotics dot com)
      Product ID: 'DAT AutoChanger '
   Quirks: firmware version 0357 does not appear to work w/mtx (request
   from ADIC that they upgrade your firmeware to 0361, which does
   seem to work), firmware version revision `0462` does work. Use 
   'mtx inquiry' to detirmine which firmware you have. 

* HP 1/20 DLT loader: "We have a HP 1/20, but I think it's all the
  same hardware. mtx works fine with it." (jo2y at midnightlinux dot com)

* Exabyte 120 (116 slots, 4 tape drives): (wsb at paralleldata dot com)
  Quirks: This loader does not properly support the loader slot assignment
  page used to allocate element structures, so the #defines must be
  changed in mtx.h for MAX_STORAGE_ELEMENTS, MAX_TRANSFER_ELEMENTS, and 
  MAX_TRANSPORT_ELEMENTS. May also need to increase the SCSI timeout to
  do inventories. Takes a LONG time to do inventories if you don't have
  bar codes!

* Exabyte 210 (wsb at paralleldata dot com)


* Adic FastStor DLT4000 (7-Slot 1 drive):
  Vendor ID: 'ADIC    '
  Product ID: 'FastStor DLT    '

* Ecrix AutoPak VXA (15-slot 1 drive) in configuration mode 0 (mark
