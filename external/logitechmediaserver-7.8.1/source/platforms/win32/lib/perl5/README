This folder contains CPAN modules which can't reside in our CPAN folder, as PerlApp, Wx or
Wx::Perl::Packager won't find them unless they're in the default Perl installation folder.

These modules are required to bundle WxPerl with cleanup.exe. The build script will copy them 
to C:\Perl\site. This target folder is hardcoded in buildme.pl.

WxPerl binaries for ActivePerl can be found at http://www.wxperl.co.uk/
