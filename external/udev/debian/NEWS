udev (0.060-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Kernels older than 2.6.12 are not fully supported anymore, and if
    used will cause a little delay in the processing of some events.
    udev users are advised to update to 2.6.12 as soon as possible.
  * Starting with this release udev will always be used as the hotplug
    multiplexer even with kernels older than 2.6.10. Using udev with
    these old kernels will break firmware loading for some drivers.
  * All rules are applied now, but only the first matching NAME attribute
    will be considered. It may be needed to add OPTIONS="last_rule" to
    custom rules to restore the precedent behavior.
  * The rules keys now support more operations, as documented in the
    man page. Rules which previously used "=" to add a value to a
    list-like variable should be changed to use "+=".
  * Support for /etc/dev.d/ and /etc/hotplug.d/ multiplexing has been
    removed from udev. Compatibility support is provided by some helper
    programs started by RUN rules in hotplugd.rules.
