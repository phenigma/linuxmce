missing:
    documentation of the PIP hotkeys.
    svdrp help page missing PIP hotkeys.
    svdrp stat: add X11 crashed status.
    more software deinterlace (yadif, ...)
    more software decoder with software deinterlace
    suspend output / energie saver: stop and restart X11
    suspend plugin didn't restore full-screen (is this wanted?)
    Option deinterlace off / deinterlace force!
    ColorSpace aren't configurable with the gui.
    works for me: restart vdr not working, when started x11 was killed.

video:
    subtitle not cleared
    subtitle could be asyncron
    grab image with hardware and better scaling support
    yaepghd changed position is lost on channel switch
    pause (live tv) has sometime problems with SAT1 HD Pro7 HD
    radio show black background
    radio no need to wait on video buffers
    starting with radio and own X11 server, shows no video
    some low-bandwidth tv channels have hiccups.
    check start with 24Hz display rate
    crash with ffmpeg without vaapi and vdpau.
    still-picture of PES recordings should use VideoMpegEnqueue.
    convert PIX_FMT_... PixelFormat to new names AV_PIX_FMT_..., AVPixelFormat.
    atmo service support 3D grab
    no warnings during still picture

vdpau:
    software deinterlace path not working.
    OSD looses transparency, during channel switch.
    OSD looses transparency, while moving cut marks.
    ffmpeg >=1.2 supports same API like VA-API.

libva:
    yaepghd (VaapiSetOutputPosition) support
    can associate only displayed part of osd
    grab image for va-api
    remove stderr output of libva init
    still many: (workaround export NO_MPEG_HW=1)
    [drm:i915_hangcheck_elapsed] *ERROR* Hangcheck timer elapsed... GPU hung
    [drm:i915_wait_request] *ERROR* i915_wait_request returns -11 ...
    missing OSD support for 3d SBS / Top-Bottom streams, like VPDAU.
    PIP support / multistream handling
    VA-AP VaapiCleanup crash after channel without video.

libva: branch vaapi-ext / staging
    add support for vaapi-ext / staging

libva-intel-driver:
    deinterlace only supported with vaapi-ext
    1080i does no v-sync (sometimes correct working with vaapi-ext)
    OSD has sometimes wrong size (workaround written)
    sometimes software decoder deinterlace isn't working and 1080i channels
    show artefacts

libva-vdpau-driver:
    G210/GT520 OSD update too slow (needs hardware problem workaround)
    hangup on exit (VaapiDelDecoder -> VaapiCleanup
	-> vaDestroyContext -> pthread_rwlock_wrlock)
    OSD still has some problems with auto-crop and 4:3 zoom.

libva-xvba-driver:

x11:
    skip multiple configure-notify, handle only the last one.
    support embedded mode

audio:
    Make alsa thread/polled and oss thread/polled output module runtime
    selectable.
    Mute should do a real mute and not only set volume to zero.
    Starting suspended and muted, didn't register the mute.
    Relaxed audio sync checks at end of packet and already in sync
    samplerate problem resume/suspend.
    only wait for video start, if video is running.
    Not primary device, don't use and block audio/video.
    multiple open of audio device, reduce them.
    Not all channel conversions are written (f.e. 2->3 ... 5->6 ...)

audio/alsa:
    remix support of unsupported sample rates

audio/oss:
    alsa oss emulation mixer "pcm" not working
    oss4 mixer channel not working
    ring buffer overflow with alsa oss emulation

HDMI/SPDIF Passthrough:
    only AC-3 written

playback of recording
    pause is not reset, when replay exit (fixed?)
    replay/pause need 100% cpu (fixed?)

plugins:
    mp3 plugin needs 100% cpu (bad ::Poll)

setup:
    Setup of decoder type.
    Setup of output type.
    Some setup parameters are not used until restart.
	Can a notice be added to the setup menu?

unsorted:
    stoping vdr while plugin is suspended opens and closes a window.
    svdrp prim: support plugin names for device numbers.
    Workaround exists: hangup PipVideoStream -> Vdpau_get_format -> xcb -> poll
	+ lock DecoderLockMutex
    check compiletime and runtime ffmpeg/libav version during init.

future features (not planed for 1.0 - 1.5)

    video out with xv
    video out with opengl
    software decoder for xv / opengl
    save and use auto-crop with channel zapping

    upmix stereo to AC-3 (supported by alsa plugin)
