vdr-plugin-xineliboutput (1.0.4+cvs20100121.1750-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Xineliboutput now has it's own config file for remote access rules:

  /etc/vdr/plugins/xineliboutput/allowed_hosts.conf

  It's basically the same as the former used svdrphosts.conf and when upgrading
  from a previous version, the vdr-plugin-xineliboutput package will copy the
  settings from there.

  For security reasons you might want to remove the old entries from
  svdrphosts.conf.

vdr-plugin-xineliboutput (1.0.4+cvs20090615.1936-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Xineliboutput now comes with its own demuxer. The "demux:mpeg_block"
  option of the Xine MRL is deprecated. So please make sure, you don't
  use the demux option as part of the MRL passed to Xine.
