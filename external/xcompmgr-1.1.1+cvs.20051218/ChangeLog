	* .cvsignore:
	* configure.ac:
	Add the foreign flag so autotools doesn't incorrectly slap a GPL on
	this, and add a .cvsignore for cvs up clarity.

2005-10-06  Eric Anholt  <anholt@FreeBSD.org>

	* xcompmgr.c: (give_me_a_name), (main):
	Make a dummy window with a name, so xrestop can point its finger at
	xcompmgr for being such a pig.

2005-01-27  Adam Jackson  <ajax@freedesktop.org>

	* xcompmgr.c:
	Bug #2391: Fix a use-after-free in run_fades.  (Jonathan Briggs)

2004-09-29  Dan Doel  <dolio@case.edu>

	* xcompmgr.c: (paint_all):
	Added some small optimizations by Thomas Luebking. paint_all
	now avoids drawing windows that don't appear on the screen,
	and doesn't bother drawing shadows on desktop windows.

2004-09-23  Dan Doel  <dolio@case.edu>

	* xcompmgr.1:
	* xcompmgr.c: (usage), (main):

	* xcompmgr.c: (presum_gaussian), (make_shadow), (main):
	Added precomputation of shadows to make them a little more
	friendly to slower computers (and make ridiculously huge
	shadows usable on faster computers).

2004-09-20  Adam Jackson  <ajax@freedesktop.org>

	* xcompmgr.c:
	Print the version number in the usage summary.

2004-09-17  Dan Doel  <dolio@case.edu>

	* xcompmgr.c: (win_extents), (usage), (main):
	Added various client-side shadow options (opacity, offset, radius)
	based on the work of Thomas Luebking.
	* xcompmgr.1:
	Added descriptions of the options in the man page.

2004-09-17  Dan Doel  <dolio@case.edu>

	* xcompmgr.c: (usage):
	Changed the usage function to describe the available options.

2004-09-17  Dan Doel  <dolio@case.edu>

	* xcompmgr.c: (shadow_picture):
	Added some tests to check for failed pixmap/picture/gc allocations and
	exit appropriately.

2004-09-14  Adam Jackson  <ajax@freedesktop.org>

	* xcompmgr.c:
	Bug #1360: Fix a segfault by checking the return value of XQueryTree.
	(Johan Kiviniemi)

2004-09-10  Adam Jackson  <ajax@freedesktop.org>

	* xcompmgr.c:

	* xcompmgr.man, Makefile.am:
	Add a man page.

2004-08-14  Keith Packard  <keithp@keithp.com>

	* xcompmgr.c: (error), (usage), (main):
	Remove abort call as it's just annoying.
	Add -a flag to just use Automatic compositing.  No glitz, but no
	screen mangling either.

2004-08-13  Keith Packard  <keithp@keithp.com>

	* xcompmgr.c: (paint_all), (repair_win), (map_win),
	(finish_unmap_win), (add_win), (configure_win), (damage_win),

	 -c:	client-side shadows (blurred, but uses window extents only)
	 -n:	no shadows (this is the default mode)
